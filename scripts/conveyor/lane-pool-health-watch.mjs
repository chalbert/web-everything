/**
 * @file scripts/conveyor/lane-pool-health-watch.mjs
 * @description THE STANDING PERIODIC HALF of `we:backlog/3568-*.md`. Every tick: read the live lane-pool
 *   status, and for every UNLEASED lane whose ENTIRE `git status --porcelain` output matches only the shared
 *   `we:scripts/lib/lane-litter.mjs#LANE_RELEASE_LITTER_ALLOWLIST`, reap it (the identical cleanup
 *   `we:scripts/lane-pool.mjs#cmdRelease` runs at release time — the SAME imported function, never a second
 *   implementation). Also reports current pool health (acquirable / dirty / leased counts) as its own
 *   `--dry-run` output.
 *
 * WHY A PERIODIC PASS IS NEEDED BESIDE THE RELEASE-TIME FIX. A release-time-only fix does nothing for litter
 * that predates the fix, or that accumulates through any path other than a normal `release` (an aborted
 * session, a killed agent, a manual abandonment leaving a leased lane's marker stranded and later TTL-reaped
 * by a path that never runs the litter cleanup). This pass reclaims that litter on the next tick instead of
 * leaving it inert until someone happens to re-release that exact lane.
 *
 * THIS PASS IS ACTION (auto-reap), NOT DETECT-ONLY — unlike `we:scripts/conveyor/duplicate-pr-watch.mjs`'s
 * alert-only stance. "Does this lane's ENTIRE dirty state match only the named allowlist" is a deterministic,
 * allowlist-scoped classification with no content judgment involved (the same reasoning
 * `we:backlog/3562-*.md` point 4 already uses to justify its own pass being action rather than alert-only) — a
 * LEASED lane, or any lane carrying so much as ONE non-allowlisted dirty path, is never touched.
 *
 * PURE CORE / IO SHELL SPLIT (mirrors `we:scripts/conveyor/duplicate-pr-watch.mjs`):
 *   • {@link planLaneReap} is PURE — no fs/git/gh/clock/process (built on top of
 *     `we:scripts/lib/lane-litter.mjs#planLitterCleanup`, itself pure).
 *   • The IO shell ({@link defaultListLaneStatus}, {@link defaultReadPorcelain}, {@link watchLanePoolHealth},
 *     {@link runLanePoolHealthWatch}, the CLI) owns every subprocess/git call.
 *
 * CONFIG KNOB. `WE_LANE_POOL_HEALTH_WATCH_DISABLED` (presence-checked, any value) — mirrors
 * `we:scripts/conveyor/queue.mjs`'s `CONVEYOR_NO_KIND_CHECK` convention — makes {@link runLanePoolHealthWatch}
 * a true no-op: no status read, no reap, no report. Checked first, inside the entrypoint itself, so
 * `we:skills-src/conveyor/runner.mjs#makeCliMechanicalPasses` needs no change to disable this pass.
 *
 * THE CADENCE. Wired into `we:skills-src/conveyor/runner.mjs#makeCliMechanicalPasses`, beside the
 * `we:scripts/conveyor/duplicate-pr-watch.mjs` / `we:scripts/conveyor/parked-pr-conflict-watch.mjs` lines — the
 * same "piggyback on a pass the headless runner already ticks" shape, so pool litter is reclaimed every tick
 * with no new cron/daemon.

 *
 * `reaped` is the list of lanes a `reap` action ACTUALLY succeeded for (empty on a `--dry-run`, or when a
 * lane's reap call threw). A lane whose plan action is `'reap'` counts as acquirable ONLY when it is in this

 * a `--dry-run` never touched it at all.
 * #3383 — live-caught 2026-09-24: this porcelain/litter plan alone is NOT the real eligibility answer. It
 * classifies a lane from `git status --porcelain` (working-tree dirt vs the shared litter allowlist) ALONE,
 * and never checks whether the lane is ahead of origin/<branch> — but `we:scripts/lane-pool.mjs`'s own real
 * gate (`acquire`'s auto-pick, and `list --acquirable`) ALWAYS also checks ahead (`effectiveDirtyOrAhead`,
 * litter-adjusted AND ahead-adjusted). Live-verified against the real WE pool: this file's own plan-only
 * classification read 14 lanes "acquirable" while `list --acquirable --json` — the exact function `acquire`
 * is built on — answered only 3; the 11 false positives were all clean-porcelain but 1-2 commits ahead of
 * origin/main (real, unpushed, correctly-protected work `acquire` would have refused, exactly the
 * "acquire's view disagrees with the health watch's" symptom this closes). `acquirableLaneNumbers`, when
 * given, is cross-referenced so a lane only counts as acquirable here when BOTH this plan AND the real
 * `list --acquirable` answer agree — the ONE shared eligibility function, reused rather than re-derived, so
 * this read-only report and `acquire`'s own auto-pick can never diverge again. `null` (the real read was
 * unavailable this tick, or the caller passed none — every existing caller/test) falls back to the
 * plan-only answer UNCHANGED, so this is purely additive.
