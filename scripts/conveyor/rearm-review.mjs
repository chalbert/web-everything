/**
 * rearm-review.mjs — re-arm a repaired conveyor fix PR for re-review after a `review:changes` bounce (#2630).
 *
 * THE ONE LABEL SWAP THE FIX AGENT IS ALLOWED TO MAKE. When a conveyor-launched PR is bounced `review:changes`
 * (a human ran `/review` and requested changes), the conveyor auto-spawns a FIX AGENT into that PR's lane (see
 * `we:skills-src/conveyor/fix-agent-brief.md`). The fix agent repairs the reviewer's finding, gets the gate
 * green, re-pushes HEAD to the `lane/*` ref — then hands the PR BACK for re-review by calling this script. It
 * swaps `review:changes → review:pending` so the drain's AI-review convergence pass (or a human) re-verdicts.
 *
 * THE INVARIANT THIS ENFORCES (the whole point — #2630): the fix agent NEVER self-clears the human review gate.
 * The `rearm` decision NEVER emits `review:accepted` and NEVER removes `review:human`. A repaired bounce goes
 * back to `review:pending` (an independent re-review is owed); if the PR also carried `review:human` (a gate-self
 * edit), that label STAYS — only a human's `/review` ceremony may clear it. So the strongest thing an auto-fix
 * can do is re-arm the review, never pass it.
 *
 * #2644 — this file is now a THIN SHIM over `we:scripts/review-set-label.mjs`. It USED to clone that file
 * byte-for-byte (`presentRemoveLabels` / `ghErr` copied verbatim, the whole gh view→decide→edit→comment→re-read
 * CLI harness duplicated); the jury (PR #702, simplicity lens) flagged the duplicated label-swap I/O boundary as
 * drift-prone. The re-arm swap is now the third target of the shared PURE `decideSetLabel` (`to: 'rearm'`), and
 * the CLI is the shared `runReviewLabelCli`. Only the three real deltas live here: the comment body, the default
 * `--actor`, and the optional-`--repo` fallback. The refusal STILL lives in the pure core, so the CLI cannot
 * route around it. Scripted per [we:docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#deterministic-core-thin-judgment] (#2607).

 * {@link REARM_COMMENT_MARKER}), so counting those comments recovers "how many times this PR was auto-fixed and
 * re-armed" from the PR ITSELF — the retry cap then binds even after a conveyor restart wipes the in-session
 * `fixAttempts` map (the exact unbounded fix↔bounce loop #2643 exists to prevent). This keeps NO parallel state
 * store (#2612 invariant): the count IS PR state, read back off the durable comment thread the re-arm swap already
 * writes through the board's normal verbs. Pure — the caller passes the PR's `comments` exactly as
 * `gh pr view <pr> --json comments` returns them (`[{ body }]`); a bare-string array is tolerated too. A comment
 * is counted only when the marker is its leading line (`trimStart().startsWith`), so a human QUOTING the re-arm
 * comment in a reply never inflates the count.

 * @returns {number} the number of conveyor re-arm comments on the PR (0 for a non-array / empty input)

/**
 * we:scripts/conveyor/rearm-review.mjs#decideRearm — the PURE re-arm decision. Now a THIN alias over the shared
 * `decideSetLabel({ to: 'rearm' })` (#2644): given the PR's OBSERVED labels, return the label swap that hands a
 * repaired `review:changes` bounce back for re-review. Kept as a named export so callers/tests read the intent
 * (`decideRearm`) rather than the generic verdict target. Every rule below is enforced in the shared pure core
 * (unbypassable):
 *   • ONLY a PR that currently carries `review:changes` can be re-armed. Anything else → `allowed:false` (an
 *     idempotent no-op: a second call after the swap refuses cleanly rather than double-applying).
 *   • The swap is ALWAYS `review:changes → review:pending`: drop the bounce, add "an independent review is
 *     owed". NEVER `review:accepted` — an auto-fix may never clear the review.
 *   • `review:human` is NEVER removed. If the bounce also carried the human gate (a gate-self edit), it stays;
 *     the re-armed PR is `review:human` + `review:pending`, still human-ceremony-only.
 * @param {{currentLabels?:Array}} o - `currentLabels` is the observed label array (string or `{name}` shape).
 * @returns {{allowed:boolean, addLabel:string, removeLabels:string[], keepsHuman:boolean, reason:string}}
