/**
 * @file scripts/conveyor/__tests__/reconcile-core.test.mjs
 * @description Pins the resident reconcile pass (WE #3296) — the dispatch and, mostly, its FOUR REFUSALS.
 *
 *   Nothing in the tree compared desired delivery state against actual: `planTick` spawns only for PRs the
 *   CURRENT session launched (`tick-core.mjs:396`), and that bookkeeping is piped in over STDIN, so it dies with
 *   the session. `planReconcile` is the pass that closes it, and the dispatch is the easy half. These cases are
 *   weighted the way the item is: one for the dispatch and its KEY, one per refusal, and one for the argv —
 *   because every refusal is a place where a plausible simplification silently re-opens the defect.
 *
 *   THE ARGV CASE IS NOT CEREMONY. Every other case here runs on injected fixtures and would stay green while
 *   the pass read the wrong PRs and reconciled nothing in production. A wrong discovery query fails SILENTLY —
 *   an empty listing reads exactly like a fleet with nothing owed.
 *
 *   THE MUTATIONS THIS FILE IS BUILT TO KILL (one per refusal, each named with the case it reddens):
 *     • drop the `stood-down` check                       → reddens case 2 only.
 *     • drop the empty-findings check                     → reddens case 3 only.
 *     • read the attempt count from an in-process tally    → reddens case 4 only.
 *     • accept a fresh transcript mtime as liveness       → reddens case 5(c) ONLY, and must leave 5(a) green.
 *
 *   That last asymmetry is the whole of refusal 4 and it is easy to get backwards: 5(a) is a LIVE pid with a
 *   STALE transcript, so a mutant that grants liveness on freshness never fires on it — the live pid refuses
 *   either way. 5(c) is a FRESH transcript with NO agent entry, which is exactly what that mutant breaks.
 *   Freshness never grants liveness; staleness never withdraws it. A mutation that reddens BOTH has removed the
 *   wrong thing. 5(b) and 5(d) carry a stale mtime too, so what their refusal turns on is the entry's own fields
 *   and nothing else.
 *
 *   Every fixture below is a shape MEASURED on 2026-08-26, not an invented one; the timestamps in the case names
 *   say when.
