/**
 * @file scripts/conveyor/__tests__/conflict-fix-round-count.test.mjs
 * @description Pins the PURE mechanical conflict-resolution round count (WE #xkmu3gv). Each completed round
 *   posts exactly ONE comment whose leading line is `CONFLICT_FIX_COMMENT_MARKER`; `countConflictFixComments`
 *   recovers the attempt count from the PR's own comment thread, keyed to its OWN round cap (never the shared
 *   negotiation cap). #3383 — also pins that ONLY a trusted author (automation or the repo operator) counts at
 *   all; no test file existed for this counter before this item.
