/**
 * @file sim-scenario-lane-starvation.test.mjs — epic #3383, scenario I-09 (report "First three scenarios" row
 * C). Fix under test: commit `1723ea4d3`, the review daemon capping dispatch by acquirable lanes
 * (`skills-src/conveyor/review-daemon.mjs#runReviewTick`'s `acquirableLanes` option, wired to the real
 * `defaultAcquirableLaneCount` only by `buildCliDaemonEffects` — the pure function's own default stays
 * unbounded `() => Infinity`, unaffected).
 *
 * SETUP: 2 lanes, 5 `review:pending` PRs — more owed than the pool can serve at once.
 *
 * The scripted review sessions do what the REAL review-agent-brief's own step 1 does first: acquire a lane —
 * `node scripts/lane-pool.mjs acquire --purpose=review-loop --session=<name> --json` (this scenario's own
 * `acquireLane()` agent action, added to `sim/agent-actions.mjs` for this build — see that file's own
 * docblock). A session that cannot get one fails exactly like a real dispatch that loses the acquire race
 * would — `acquireLane`'s own failure branch mirrors {@link ../sim/agent-actions.mjs#failNoLane} byte for
 * byte. The whole point of the fix under test is that THIS should never actually happen: the daemon's own
 * dispatch cap is supposed to never fire more sessions than lanes exist to serve them.
 *
 * `LANE_POOL_ACQUIRE_GROWTH_MAX_NEW=0` (#3383, `scripts/lane-pool.mjs`'s own `acquire` auto-pick growth,
 * `1723ea4d3`'s OTHER half) is pinned in this scenario's own env: `acquire`'s auto-pick path growing the pool
 * past a genuinely starved reading would let a session succeed anyway, masking whether the review daemon's
 * OWN dispatch cap is what is actually bounding concurrency here — pinning growth to zero makes the 2-lane
 * pool a hard ceiling, so if the daemon ever over-dispatches, the excess session's `acquireLane()` genuinely
 * fails instead of quietly growing its way past the defect.
 *
 * PLAY: `tick review` dispatches at most 2 (never all 5); the scenario then runs each dispatched pair fully
 * to completion (acquire → verdict → release → exit) before ticking again for the next batch, exactly the
 * "deferred reviews stay owed and simply reappear next tick" behaviour `runReviewTick`'s own docblock
 * describes. Three ticks cover all five PRs (2 + 2 + 1).
