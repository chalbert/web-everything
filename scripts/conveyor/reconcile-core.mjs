/**
 * reconcile-core.mjs — the PURE reconcile pass (#3296): compare DESIRED delivery state against ACTUAL, for
 * every open PR, and return what to dispatch plus every refusal and the fact each turned on.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Nothing in the tree reconciles an open PR against a live process. `planTick`'s two spawns are
 * gated on `if (!launched.has(normNum(p.num))) continue; // only PRs THIS conveyor launched`
 * (`we:scripts/conveyor/tick-core.mjs:396` for fixes, `:495` for CI-heals), and `launchedNums` is
 * SESSION-EPHEMERAL bookkeeping piped in over STDIN — so the moment the supervising session exits, every PR it
 * launched becomes a PR no conveyor launched, owned by nothing. `planTick`'s `decisions`
 * (`we:scripts/conveyor/tick-core.mjs:855-866`) contain no review spawn at all, so a `review:pending` PR is
 * WATCHED and never WORKED. The residue is a person: a human dispatched every reviewer and every healer that ran
 * today.
 *
 * THE COMMON THREAD, and the reason this is one item rather than six fixes: every failure is **a proxy standing
 * in for a fact nobody checks**. A session's `launchedNums` stands in for ownership. A label stands in for a
 * process. A file mtime stands in for liveness. A resolved card stands in for an idle lane. This pass replaces
 * the proxies with the facts, and where it cannot get a fact it says so out loud instead of guessing.
 *
 * KEYED BY PR NUMBER, NEVER BY ITEM NUMBER. This is not a preference. Measured 2026-08-26 17:34Z, all four open
 * PRs' head refs (`lane/review-slice-scopes`, `lane/review-pr-override-reason`, `lane/review-corpus-replay`,
 * `lane/review-efficacy-watch`) return `null` from `laneRefItemNum`
 * (`we:scripts/conveyor/lease-reaper.mjs`), whose grammar is `^lane/(x[a-z0-9]{5,7}|\d+)[a-z]?-`. An item-keyed
 * pass would therefore have seen ZERO of the four PRs it exists to reconcile. `reconcile-core.test.mjs` pins that
 * difference as an assertion rather than leaving it as a design note.
 *
 * PHASE IS BORROWED, NOT RE-DERIVED. `classifyPr` (`we:scripts/progress-board.mjs`) gives the label phase and
 * `reduceCheckState` (`we:scripts/operations/pr-status.mjs`, #3247) gives CI truth. A second derivation is the
 * defect, not the feature — it is how the board and the reconciler come to disagree about what a PR is doing. If
 * this pass ever needs a fact those two do not expose, WIDEN THEM; do not grow a private copy here.
 *
 * ON `pr-status`'s OWN WORDING: its `CHECK_STATES` is a frozen list of FOUR — `green`, `red`, `pending`,
 * `unchecked` — while the docblock above it says "three-valued". Four is what it freezes and four is what this
 * file consumes, because the distinction that matters here is exactly the fourth: `unchecked` is NOT a flavour of
 * `pending`. Zero check runs on a head means nothing has been asked about that commit, which never satisfies a
 * gate. Do not inherit the "three-valued" phrasing.
 *
 * THE DISPATCH IS THE EASY HALF — THE FOUR REFUSALS ARE THE ITEM:
 *
 *   1. `stood-down` is TERMINAL. An agent that stopped to ask a question is never restarted; re-running it
 *      re-asks the question forever and burns tokens. Read from the durable marker
 *      `we:scripts/conveyor/stand-down.mjs` posts — no decay, no clock, so the verdict is identical a week later.
 *   2. NO FINDINGS, NO FIXER. A PR with nothing to fix must never receive a fix agent; it will invent work. The
 *      right answer for a `review:pending` PR with no findings is a REVIEW, not a fix.
 *   3. THE ROUND CAP SURVIVES A RESTART, OR IT IS NOT A CAP. The attempt count is derived from the PR and ONLY
 *      from the PR. No in-process tally is read here — not as a floor, not as an overlay, not at all. Measured:
 *      `countRearmComments` read `0` on all four open PRs, and read `0` on `#1563` through all TWELVE of its
 *      review rounds against a `NEGOTIATION_ROUND_CAP` of 5. A cap that resets on restart is not a cap.
 *   4. LIVENESS COMES FROM A LIVE PROCESS — AND THE LISTING IS THINNER THAN IT LOOKS. See below; this is the one
 *      that pins cause 6, and the one most likely to be "simplified" into a bug.
 *
 * REFUSAL 4 IN FULL, because every part of it was measured and every part of it is a trap.
 *
 *   • THE LISTING IS PARTIAL. Over the 17 live sessions `claude agents --json` returned at 17:34Z, the union of
 *     keys is exactly `cwd, id, kind, name, pid, sessionId, startedAt, state, status, waitingFor`. Only
 *     `cwd`/`kind`/`name`/`sessionId`/`startedAt` appear on all 17. `pid` appears on 13, `state` on 7, and
 *     `status` + `waitingFor` on 3. **A missing `pid` is not a dead process and a missing `state` is not a
 *     healthy one.** Absence is UNKNOWN, and unknown refuses — it never reads as idle.
 *   • THE LISTING CARRIES NO PR. There is no `pr`, `item`, `num`, `branch` or `ref` field on ANY entry, so the
 *     PR↔session binding must be DERIVED. For a build/prepare dispatch the only derivation available is `cwd` →
 *     that lane's `HEAD` → the PR's `headRefOid`, and that rule PRODUCED A FALSE POSITIVE while #3296 was being
 *     prepared: it bound the preparing session to PR `#1571`, because a second agent had reset the shared
 *     `lane-35` checkout to `#1571`'s head underneath it (`#3283`, observed live rather than argued). So the
 *     binding is ITSELF a proxy. For a REVIEW dispatch it is worse than a rare false positive — it essentially
 *     NEVER matches at all: `review-dispatch.mjs` spawns the review agent with `cwd: REPO_ROOT` (the primary
 *     checkout) and its brief never `cd`s into the lane it later acquires for itself, so the cwd/oid rule reads
 *     the wrong checkout's HEAD on every review session, first round or re-armed (#3437, confirmed live
 *     2026-09-01: SEVEN independent sessions spawned across ~15 minutes against one re-armed PR, because none
 *     ever bound). {@link bindAgents} therefore carries a SECOND bind path for this dispatch kind — the session
 *     `name` (`review-<pr>`, 100% populated on a review-dispatch session, unlike `pid`/`state`) — unioned with
 *     the cwd/oid path rather than replacing it, since no PR-specific session name exists for build/prepare.
 *     Every liveness refusal still carries the `cwd` and the `sha` it turned on — `sha` is always the PR's own
 *     `headRefOid`, so when only the name path matched it reads as evidence the reader can compare against the
 *     bound agent's OWN `laneHeadOid` (they will differ, which is exactly what proves the cwd/oid path did not
 *     catch it). Widening the listing to carry a PR field would fix the cwd/oid path properly — it is a change
 *     to a tool this repo does not own, so it is named, not absorbed.
 *   • `waitingFor: 'permission prompt'` IS A FIFTH STATE, neither alive nor dead. Three sessions have held one
 *     for 211.4 hours. It refuses dispatch AND surfaces under its own kind, or the 211-hour case repeats
 *     silently.
 *   • A TIMESTAMP IS NOT A HEARTBEAT. `we:scripts/readiness/conveyor-state.mjs` treats a transcript's mtime as
 *     its last-activity clock, and it is right to within what a timestamp can mean — but a transcript stops
 *     being written when an agent FINISHES exactly as it does when an agent DIES. So `transcriptMtimeMs` is
 *     carried through this file as EVIDENCE ONLY and is never read by any decision: **freshness never grants
 *     liveness, and staleness never withdraws it.** A live `pid` refuses however stale its transcript is; a fresh
 *     transcript with no agent entry behind it still dispatches. That asymmetry is load-bearing and
 *     `reconcile-core.test.mjs` pins both halves — a change that reddens both has removed the wrong thing.
 *
 * EVERY PR PRODUCES A ROW. A pass that refuses four PRs and prints one line has reproduced the original defect
 * one level up, so nothing is dropped silently: each open PR yields either a dispatch or a refusal, and each
 * refusal names its kind, its PR, and the fact it turned on. {@link planReconcile} guarantees the row count
 * equals the PR count.
 *
 * WHAT THIS PASS DOES NOT DO: it does not RUN a review (the review loop and its converged / exhausted / stuck
 * vocabulary are #3072); it does not spawn the reviewer session (#3279 declares that operation — this decides
 * that a review is owed and calls it); it does not dispose a `review:pending` PR from a jury ledger
 * (`we:scripts/review-runner.mjs` owns that, and its shadow→enforce flip is #2572 part 2); it does not reap a
 * permission-blocked session (it SURFACES the 211-hour case; clearing it is a separate job); and it changes no
 * label's meaning and adds no label — the stand-down signal is a comment marker.
 *
 * PURE: no fs, no clock, no process, no network. Every impure fact (a `pid`'s liveness, a lane's `HEAD`, a
 * transcript's mtime) is INJECTED on the input records by `we:scripts/conveyor/reconcile-pass.mjs`, so every
 * branch below is reachable in a test with no network and no credential.

 * we:scripts/conveyor/reconcile-core.mjs#bindAgents — derive which live sessions are working THIS PR, and return

 * dispatch essentially never matches the first one; see below):
 *
 * PATH 1 — `cwd` → that lane's `HEAD` → the PR's `headRefOid`. THE BINDING IS A PROXY AND IT IS RETURNED AS ONE.
 * `claude agents --json` carries no `pr`, `item`, `num`, `branch` or `ref` field on any entry — measured over
 * all 17 live sessions — so this is the only rule available for a build/prepare dispatch, which carries no
 * PR-specific session identity at all. `laneHeadOid` is resolved by the IO shell (this file cannot read a git
 * ref) and compared here. The rule is known to produce false positives when two agents share a checkout and one
 * resets it under the other (#3283, observed live at 17:34Z). A blank/absent `headRefOid` or `laneHeadOid` binds
 * NOTHING on this path — two unknowns are not a match, and treating them as one would bind every session to
 * every PR.
 *
 * PATH 2 — session `name` === `review-<pr>` OR `fix-<pr>`. THIS PATH EXISTS BECAUSE PATH 1 CANNOT EVER MATCH A
 * REVIEW-DISPATCH SESSION, first round or re-armed, working or not (#3437, confirmed live 2026-09-01: SEVEN
 * independent `review-1765` sessions spawned across ~15 minutes of ticks against one re-armed PR, because none
 * ever bound).
 * `we:scripts/operations/review-dispatch.mjs` spawns the review agent with `cwd: REPO_ROOT` — the PRIMARY
 * checkout, per that file's own docblock — and the review agent's own brief never `cd`s the agent's shell into
 * the lane it later acquires for itself (the lane is a flag to a subprocess, not the agent's own cwd). So
 * `resolveLaneHead(cwd)` for a `review-<pr>` session always reads the PRIMARY checkout's HEAD, which essentially
 * never equals `pr.headRefOid` — path 1 is not "rare false positives" for this dispatch kind, it is a near-total
 * miss. What a review-dispatch session DOES carry, 100% of the time, is a PR-specific `name`
 * (`we:scripts/conveyor/review-session-slug.mjs#reviewSessionSlug`, spawned via `-n <slug>` and echoed verbatim
 * on every `claude agents --json` entry — unlike `pid`/`state`, `name` is on all 17 measured entries). Matching
 * on it needs no `headRefOid` at all, so it still binds when path 1's sha is blank.
 *
 * THE SAME NAME-BASED GAP APPLIES TO A FIX DISPATCH (#3438), and for the identical reason: once a
 * `we:scripts/conveyor/reconcile-fix-dispatch.mjs` fix agent has made its first commit in its acquired lane, its
 * lane's `HEAD` has advanced past the PR's still-unpushed `headRefOid` — path 1 goes blind at exactly the moment
 * the fix agent starts doing real work, which is the #3437 double-dispatch shape recurring one dispatch kind
 * over. `fix-<pr>` (`we:scripts/operations/dispatch-lane.mjs#sessionSlugFor(pr, 'fix')`) is ALREADY the session
 * name both `dispatch-lane.mjs`'s own tick-core-driven fix dispatch (#3332) and `reconcile-fix-dispatch.mjs`
 * spawn a fix agent under, so matching it here needs no new naming scheme, only reading the one that already
 * exists.
 *
 * A NAME IS A WEAKER PROXY THAN A GIT SHA — NAMED DELIBERATELY. Nothing stops a `claude agents --json` entry
 * from carrying `name: "review-1234"` (or `"fix-1234"`) for a reason that has nothing to do with working PR
 * #1234 (a person's own manually-named debug session, for instance); that entry would now bind and could
 * suppress a real dispatch. This repo does not treat `claude agents --json` as adversarial input — it reflects
 * genuinely running local processes, and forging an entry in it already requires local code execution — so the
 * trade is accepted rather than defended against here.
 *
 * Both paths' hits are unioned into one bound list, keyed by AGENT OBJECT IDENTITY in the `Map` below (so a
 * session that happens to satisfy both paths is stored once, not twice, with no separate dedup check needed —
 * a second `.set()` on the same key simply overwrites with the same value), and pass through the SAME liveness
 * assessment below — the union widens WHAT can bind, it does not change what a bind MEANS.

/**
 * we:scripts/conveyor/reconcile-core.mjs#assessLiveness — the liveness verdict for ONE PR, over the sessions
 * bound to it. Pure, and it is refusal 4 in code.
 *
 * ORDER IS THE SAFETY PROPERTY, worst-first, and it is not the order that reads most naturally:
 *   1. `awaiting-permission` OUTRANKS a live pid. Those three sessions have live pids; reporting them as merely
 *      "busy" is how a 211-hour block stays invisible. The distinct kind is the whole point.
 *   2. `live-process` — a bound session with a probed-live pid. Something IS working this PR; do not pile on.
 *   3. `liveness-unknown` — bound, but the `pid` is absent (4 of 17 entries carry none) or was not probed.
 *      Absence of a field is never evidence of death, so this REFUSES. It does not read as idle. A session
 *      confirmed stuck by other means (the GH #77683 zombie bug — `claude stop`/`claude rm` fail or no-op) is
 *      cleared via `we:scripts/operations/clear-stuck-session.mjs`, never by hand-moving its job directory or
 *      re-deriving a second liveness check.
 *   4. Only when every bound session is probed DEAD (`pidAlive === false`) does this return `null`, meaning
 *      "nothing live here, the caller may dispatch".
 *
 * `transcriptMtimeMs` is not consulted anywhere in this function, ON PURPOSE. A transcript stops being written
 * when an agent finishes exactly as when it dies, so freshness cannot grant liveness and staleness cannot
 * withdraw it. It rides along as evidence only.
 *
 * A session reporting `state: 'done'` is filtered out BEFORE any of the four ranks above, regardless of
 * `pidAlive` (live-caught #xq7g45m, PR #2461, 2026-09-22): in this environment a finished background agent's OS
 * process is recycled into a warm bg-spare pool rather than exiting, so `pidAlive` stays `true` forever after
 * the actual work on this PR is long done — the pid didn't die, it was just handed to unrelated later work. A
 * raw pid probe is only a stand-in for a session that has NOT reported its own terminal state; once an agent
 * says `done`, that is authoritative and a live pid proves nothing about THIS PR anymore.
 *
 * The same holds for a session whose OWN completion record says done ({@link markSelfReportedDone} sets
 * `selfReportedDone`), even when the listing still reads `blocked` (xpb0zyq, live 2026-09-23).

 *
 * EVERY PR YIELDS EXACTLY ONE ROW — a dispatch or a refusal, never neither. Silence is the defect this pass
 * exists to remove, so it is not allowed to reappear in this pass's own output.
 *
 * THE ORDER OF THE CHECKS, and why each sits where it does:
 *   1. `stood-down` FIRST, because it is terminal. Nothing that follows can revive a PR a fixer walked away
 *      from, so nothing that follows should even be computed.
 *   2. LIVENESS SECOND. If something is already working this PR, no further question is worth asking — and
 *      asking anyway is how two agents end up in one lane.
 *   3. PHASE, borrowed from `classifyPr`. What is owed, and by whom.
 *   4. FINDINGS, before the cap: a PR with nothing to fix gets a review or nothing, never a fixer, whatever its
 *      attempt count says.
 *   5. THE CAP, from the PR and only from the PR.
 *
 * @param {object} o
 * @param {Array<object>} [o.prs] - open PRs as `gh pr list --json number,headRefName,headRefOid,baseRefName,
 *   labels,statusCheckRollup,mergeStateStatus,comments` returns them, each optionally carrying `transcriptMtimeMs`
 *   (EVIDENCE ONLY — no decision reads it). `baseRefName` is what the STACKED-BASE CONFLICT branch keys on
 *   (#3383); its absence just means every `conflicted` PR falls through to the pre-#3383 `owed-elsewhere` path.
 * @param {Array<object>} [o.agents] - `claude agents --json` entries, each optionally carrying the two facts the
 *   listing cannot supply and the IO shell resolves: `laneHeadOid` (the `HEAD` of the lane at `cwd`) and
 *   `pidAlive` (`process.kill(pid, 0)` → `true`/`false`; absent = not probed = UNKNOWN).
 * @param {object} [o.durableCounts] - `{ [prNumber]: n }`, the PR-derived attempt count the shell reads back
 *   with `countRearmComments`. There is NO in-process tally parameter and none is consulted: a cap that a
 *   restart can reset is not a cap.
 * @param {number} [o.now] - epoch ms, used ONLY to age the surfaced permission-block notes. No decision reads it,
 *   so the plan for a given input is stable over time — a `stood-down` PR returns an identical result a week on.
 * @param {number} [o.roundCap] - the attempt cap; defaults to `NEGOTIATION_ROUND_CAP` (5), single-sourced from
 *   `we:scripts/lib/jury-core.mjs` rather than re-declared here.
 * @param {number} [o.ciHealCap] - the `ci-red` attempt cap (multi-repo slice 7); defaults to
 *   {@link CI_HEAL_ROUND_CAP} (3). Deliberately its OWN cap, not `roundCap`: a CI-heal round and a fix/review
 *   negotiation round are different work (a rebase-and-repair vs. a finding-and-fix), so binding them to one
 *   shared counter would let a PR burn through one cap doing the other kind of work.
 * @param {number} [o.conflictFixCap] - the mechanical conflict-resolution attempt cap (#xkmu3gv); defaults to
 *   {@link CONFLICT_FIX_ROUND_CAP} (3). See that constant's own docblock for why it is separate from `roundCap`.
 * @param {number} [o.advisoryFixCap] - the advisory-fix attempt cap on a `needs-human` PR (#xkmu3gv); defaults
 *   to {@link ADVISORY_FIX_ROUND_CAP} (3). See that constant's own docblock for why it is separate from
 *   `roundCap`.
 * @param {string} [o.defaultBranch] - the repo's default branch (#3383); defaults to `'main'`. A `conflicted`
 *   PR whose `baseRefName` differs from this is STACKED (built on another lane/PR) — see the STACKED-BASE
 *   CONFLICT branch below for why that population needs its own dispatch rather than the generic
 *   `owed-elsewhere` refusal.

      // refusing `stood-down` — and immediately hit a THIRD gap instead: `cap-exhausted` at `5/5` against
      // `NEGOTIATION_ROUND_CAP`. That 5 is `countAdvisoryComments` — the very COUNT OF ADVISORY NOTES, i.e. the
      // number of times a review has ALREADY RUN against this PR — fed into a cap meant to bound REPEATED
      // FAILURE to converge (#2117/#2298's own motivating incident: a bounced PR that never completes a
      // rearm). Applying that same floor to "a review is owed right now, because the finding it will judge was
      // JUST mechanically proven fixed" cannot be right: it caps the discovery step by counting its own past
      // discoveries, and #2549 had genuinely spent that count on ORDINARY history predating the `#xkmu3gv`
      // marker regime entirely (5 rounds, 1 genuine advisory-fix) — capping it here would leave the PR
      // PERMANENTLY stuck at `cap-exhausted` even though the actual finding is provably addressed and nothing
      // further is owed except letting the review run.

      // THE SMALLER OF TWO SAFE FIXES (a full dedicated `ADVISORY_REVIEW_ROUND_CAP` counter, counted only from

/**
 * we:scripts/conveyor/reconcile-core.mjs#selectStatusCandidates — PURE: which PRs deserve an informative
 * `review-status:*` refresh (`we:scripts/conveyor/review-status-tag.mjs`) this tick, given this pass's own
 * `dispatch`/`refusals` output.
 *
 * EVERY PR THIS PASS HAS AN OPINION ABOUT, EXCEPT `nothing-owed`. `nothing-owed` is the ONLY refusal kind that
 * genuinely means "reviewed and queued, already landed, or a signal-free PR unrelated to this loop" — see
 * {@link OWED_ELSEWHERE}. `owed-elsewhere` does NOT mean that: it fires for a `needs-human`/`conflicted` phase
 * alike (`ci-red` moved OFF this table at multi-repo slice 7 — it is a real `dispatch` entry, `kind:'ci-heal'`,
 * now, not a refusal), which are real conveyor-dispatched PRs stuck on something this pass does not run (a
 * human clear, a rebase) — NOT unrelated PRs. Before this function existed,
 * `we:skills-src/conveyor/runner.mjs`'s own inline filter excluded `owed-elsewhere` wholesale on the mistaken
 * premise that it "covers every unrelated human PR" — confirmed live 2026-09-05 on PR #1920: its `needs-human`
 * refusal (kind `owed-elsewhere`) was excluded from every tick's refresh sweep, so its stale
 * `review-status:reviewing` label — left over from a session that no longer exists in `claude agents --json`
 * at all — was NEVER re-derived and cleared. `review-status-tag.mjs` is idempotent and name-keyed (matches
 * `review-<pr>`/`fix-<pr>` sessions fresh each call), so calling it on a PR with nothing live simply clears any
 * stale label — safe to call on every candidate this returns, including a genuinely-foreign PR that happens to
 * reach `owed-elsewhere` (a wasted `gh`/`claude agents` read at worst, never a wrong label).
 * SAME BUG CLASS, THIRD TIME (live-caught 2026-09-22, PR #2472): a PR that moves to being owed a FIX
 * (`plan.dispatch`'s `kind:'fix'` entries — e.g. a `review:changes` bounce) used to be in NEITHER
 * `reviewsOwed` NOR `refusals`, so its status label never got re-derived once it left the review-owed
 * state. PR #2472's own `review-2472` session finished and posted its real `review:changes` verdict, but
 * `review-status:reviewing` sat stale on the PR for ~2 hours — nothing ever called `review-status-tag.mjs`
 * for it again to notice the session was `done` and clear the label. Exactly the same root shape as the
 * `owed-elsewhere` miss documented above (a real, currently-relevant PR silently excluded from the refresh
 * sweep), just a different exclusion. Fixed by adding `fixesOwed` as a THIRD candidate source, included the
 * same unconditional way `reviewsOwed` already is — `review-status-tag.mjs` stays idempotent and
 * name-keyed, so including a fix-owed PR here costs one wasted read at worst on a genuinely quiet PR, never
 * a wrong label.
 * @param {Array<{prNumber:number}>} reviewsOwed - the `kind:'review'` subset of this pass's own `dispatch`
