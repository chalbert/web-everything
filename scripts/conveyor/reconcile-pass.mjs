/**
 * reconcile-pass.mjs — the thin IO shell around `we:scripts/conveyor/reconcile-core.mjs` (#3296): read the four
 * facts the pure pass needs, run it, and REPORT every dispatch and every refusal.
 *
 * A ONE-SHOT PASS, NOT A RESIDENT PROCESS. It reads, decides, prints and exits — the shape
 * `we:scripts/converge-daemon-pass.mjs` already argues for ("a `StartInterval` job is the whole daemon, and it
 * costs one plist"). Folding this into the conveyor tick was REFUSED on the evidence: that tick's bookkeeping
 * (`launchedNums`, `fixGuards`, `watched`) is piped in over STDIN and is session-ephemeral by construction, so a
 * reconciler living inside it would forget every PR the moment the session that launched them exited — which is
 * the exact defect being fixed, reintroduced one level down.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE ADDS, AND ALL IT ADDS: the four impure facts the core cannot read.
 *   1. The open PRs — `gh pr list --state open --json number,headRefName,headRefOid,labels,statusCheckRollup,
 *      mergeStateStatus,comments`.
 *   2. The live sessions — `claude agents --json`, via `defaultListAgents`
 *      (`we:scripts/operations/dispatch-lane-io.mjs`), REUSED rather than rebuilt so the two callers can never
 *      ask the tool different questions.
 *   3. `laneHeadOid` per session — `git -C <cwd> rev-parse HEAD`. The listing carries no `pr`, `item`, `num`,
 *      `branch` or `ref` field on any entry (measured over all 17 live sessions), so the PR↔session binding must
 *      be derived, and this is the only derivation available today. It is a PROXY and it has been observed to be
 *      wrong (#3283), which is why the core carries the `cwd` and `sha` out to every liveness refusal.
 *   4. `pidAlive` per session — `process.kill(pid, 0)`. A `pid` is on only 13 of 17 entries; where it is absent
 *      this stays UNDEFINED and the core refuses as `liveness-unknown`. It must never be defaulted to `false`:
 *      absence of a field is not evidence of death.
 *
 * WHY THE ARGV IS PINNED BY A TEST AND NOT MERELY EXERCISED. The failure mode of a wrong discovery query is
 * SILENCE, not an error: an empty listing is indistinguishable from "no PR needs anything", so a query that
 * matches nothing looks exactly like a perfectly reconciled fleet. Every other case in
 * `reconcile-core.test.mjs` passes on injected fixtures and would stay green while this pass reconciled nothing
 * in production. `--state open` is the load-bearing flag here, and it is deliberately NOT the `--state all` that
 * `we:scripts/operations/__tests__/dispatch-lane-defaults.test.mjs` pins for a different reader: that reader
 * resolves on MERGED PRs, this one reconciles OPEN ones, and copying the flag across would hide every PR this
 * pass exists to see. `headRefOid` is load-bearing for the same reason — without it the liveness binding has
 * nothing to compare a lane `HEAD` against, and every PR would read as unowned.
 *
 * IT DISPATCHES NOTHING ITSELF. The pass decides that a fix or a review is OWED and reports it; spawning the
 * independent reviewer is #3279's operation and running the review loop is #3072. Emitting a plan a caller acts
 * on keeps this pass a READ, which is what makes it safe to run on an interval.
 *
 * SINGLETON-LEASED THE WAY `we:scripts/review-runner.mjs` LEASES — the lease belongs to whatever schedules this
 * (the plist / the conveyor), not to the read itself, and is NOT taken here: two concurrent reads of a PR list
 * cannot corrupt anything, and a lease taken inside a one-shot read is a lease nothing releases when the process
 * is killed.

 *   `number`            — THE KEY. This pass is keyed by PR number, never item number (all four open head refs
 *                         measured today return `null` from `laneRefItemNum`).
 *   `headRefName`       — human evidence on every row, so a reader can find the branch.
 *   `headRefOid`        — the liveness binding compares it against a lane's `HEAD`. Without it nothing binds.
 *   `labels`            — what `classifyPr` reads for the phase.
 *   `statusCheckRollup` — what `classifyPr` and `reduceCheckState` read for CI truth.
 *   `mergeStateStatus`  — what `classifyPr` reads to spot a conflicted / behind branch.
 *   `comments`          — the durable thread: the findings count, the re-arm count, and the stand-down marker
 *                         all come off it. Dropping it silently zeroes all three.
