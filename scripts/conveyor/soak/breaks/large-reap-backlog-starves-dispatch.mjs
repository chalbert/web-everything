/**
 * @file breaks/large-reap-backlog-starves-dispatch.mjs — LIVE INCIDENT, 2026-09-26 18:02 ET (epic #3383). The
 * review daemon (`we:skills-src/conveyor/review-daemon.mjs`) restarted onto the code that wires
 * `we:scripts/conveyor/session-reaper.mjs#runSessionReaperPass` into its own tick. Since nothing had ever
 * reaped before that, its FIRST tick found ~1,500 old finished sessions and worked through them one `claude
 * stop` at a time (~95/min, a real measured rate) — 15+ minutes with NOTHING else in this single-threaded
 * daemon able to run: no review dispatched, no `review-status:*` tag refreshed, the whole time. Discovered a
 * SECOND, sharper way to hit the same wall the same night: the reap was moved to run BEFORE discovery so a PR
 * freed by reaping its own stale blocker could be picked up the SAME tick — which means an unbounded backlog
 * now blocks discovery+dispatch EVERY tick, not just the first.
 *
 * `runSessionReaperPass` had no notion of "enough for this tick" at all — it kept `claude stop`-ing every
 * reap candidate the listing produced, however many, before ever returning control to its caller.
 *
 * FIX (this same PR, epic #3383): `runSessionReaperPass` now takes a per-tick BUDGET —
 * `maxStops`/`maxDurationMs` ({@link ../../session-reaper.mjs#DEFAULT_REAP_MAX_STOPS_PER_PASS}/
 * {@link ../../session-reaper.mjs#DEFAULT_REAP_MAX_DURATION_MS}, both env-overridable via
 * `WE_SESSION_REAP_MAX_STOPS`/`WE_SESSION_REAP_MAX_DURATION_MS`) — whichever bound is hit first ends that
 * pass's reaping; every candidate the budget didn't reach is simply left for the next tick's fresh listing
 * (never lost, never double-reaped once actually stopped). `we:skills-src/conveyor/review-daemon.mjs`'s own
 * `defaultReapSessions` forwards this straight through, so the real daemon is bounded with no extra wiring.
 *
 * SCENARIO. The plain soak world's default fleet already seeds the trigger population: PR `pending` (always
 * PR #1, `we:scripts/conveyor/soak/fleet.mjs`) owes a review. Before the review daemon's very first tick,
 * this scenario seeds `BACKLOG_SIZE` already-`done` sessions directly into the fake `claude` store — the
 * exact shape a long-neglected reaper backlog has: `kind:'background'`, `state:'done'`, `cwd` = the daemon's
 * OWN clone (so `allowedCwd` accepts them as real candidates), no live pid. `WE_SESSION_REAP_MAX_STOPS` is
 * pinned to a small test value (never this scenario's job to also pin the PRODUCTION-sized default — that is
 * `we:scripts/conveyor/__tests__/session-reaper.test.mjs`'s own job) so the scenario proves the CAP EXISTS
 * AND IS HONORED, at a backlog size and tick bound that stay fast to run either way.
 *
 * RED (pre-fix) = the daemon's first tick tries to `claude stop` all `BACKLOG_SIZE` sessions before ever
 * calling discovery — measured (see this file's own calibration) at ~58ms per fake-CLI `stop` spawn, so a
 * backlog many times smaller than the real 1,500 still comfortably blows `TICK_BOUND_MS`; the harness's own
 * per-tick IPC timeout (`we:scripts/conveyor/__tests__/sim/scenario.mjs`'s `tickDaemon`) fires from the
 * PARENT process (never blocked by the child's synchronous reap loop) and the tick is recorded 'bounded'.
 * GREEN (post-fix) = the SAME backlog reaps only `WE_SESSION_REAP_MAX_STOPS` sessions this tick, finishes
 * comfortably inside `TICK_BOUND_MS`, and discovery+dispatch runs right after in the same tick — PR #1 is
 * dispatched a review within the grace window.

 *  this harness — so `TICK_BOUND_MS` below must clear THAT floor too, not just the reap cost. 300 sessions is
 *  ~17s of unbounded reap on top of that floor — comfortably over the bound with margin, while staying well
 *  under this tier's own multi-minute norm (this file's own header: "Minutes, not seconds"). The REAL incident
 *  was ~1,500; this scenario does not need that scale to prove the cap fires — see `we:scripts/conveyor/soak/
