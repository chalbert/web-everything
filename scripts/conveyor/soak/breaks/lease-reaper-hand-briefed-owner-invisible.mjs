/**
 * @file breaks/lease-reaper-hand-briefed-owner-invisible.mjs — live break, confirmed 2026-09-28 (still unfixed on
 * `main`), fixed by we:backlog/xbk2is9-lease-reaper-session-gone-axis-reaps-hand-briefed.md (PR body carries the
 * item number; the card itself is filed on PR #2863, not yet on `main` at the time this break was written).
 *
 * LIVE INCIDENT. A delivery agent started BY HAND — an in-process Agent-tool subagent following
 * `we:skills-src/conveyor/delivery-agent-brief.md` directly, never `claude --bg` — still acquires its lane with
 * `--session=conveyor-<N>`, because that is the ONLY grammar `we:scripts/conveyor/lease-reaper.mjs#itemNumFromSession`
 * (and the dispatch observer) recognize. `sessionGoneForLease` then looks THAT exact name up in
 * `claude agents --json --all` — and an in-process subagent is never listed there under its own manufactured
 * name; only its OWNING interactive session is (a real `claude agents` row, `kind: 'interactive'`, keyed by
 * `sessionId`). Once the 10-minute listing-visibility grace window passes, the reaper read "never listed" as
 * "gone" and force-released the lease while the agent was still working — measured live across ~10 lanes in one
 * evening (lane-18, lane-5, lane-12, lane-13, lane-14, lane-16, lane-17, lane-20, lane-21, lane-22; lane-21 four
 * times as its worker kept re-acquiring), with the SAME lease's `workerSession` independently confirmed live at
 * the exact same moment by the reclaim `--salvage` gate's own `liveAgentInLane` check ("owning session is still
 * live (claude agents)") — the reaper and the reclaim gate disagreed about the SAME lease's liveness.
 *
 * FIX (#xbk2is9): in the ABSENCE branch only — never overriding a direct death signal about the lease's own
 * tracked session (a listed terminal state, or a real `pidAlive === false` read) — check the lease's declared
 * occupant, `workerSession` (never `ownerSession`, the dispatcher's own long-lived id — see
 * `ownerSessionAliveForLease`'s own doc for why that would be a DIFFERENT, worse bug), against the SAME listing
 * via `ownerSessionAliveForLease`, REUSING (not re-deriving) the reclaim gate's own `liveAgentInLane`
 * (`lib/lane-salvage.mjs`).
 *
 * SCENARIO (no daemon tick loop — this incident lives in the RESIDENT `lease-reaper.mjs --dry-run` pass, same
 * shape as this file's own sibling `lease-reaper-merge-commit-blind-spot.mjs`; `daemons: []`). ONE throwaway
 * `LANE_POOL_ROOT` pool named `web-everything`, `--no-check-prs` (this incident is entirely on the session-gone
 * axis, not the PR-terminal one), a fake `claude` answering `agents --json --all` with TWO rows: the
 * hand-briefed agent's OWNING interactive session (listed and live, under NEITHER lease's own dispatcher-grammar
 * `session` name — the whole point: an in-process subagent is never listed under its own name) plus one
 * unrelated `background` row that exists ONLY to keep the session-gone axis itself from degrading OFF (a listing
 * with zero background rows reads as "indistinguishable from a bad read" — #1921 — which would make this
 * scenario prove nothing either way; see the `setup` comment below):
 *   - **lane-1 (the incident)**: session `conveyor-9401` (a real, hand-briefed delivery agent's own acquire
 *     name), `workerSession: 'owner-session-abc123'` (stamped by `--adopt`, the SAME field the reclaim gate's
 *     own `liveAgentInLane` already reads), acquired 30 minutes ago — comfortably past the 10-minute grace
 *     window, nowhere near the 240-minute TTL. `owner-session-abc123` IS the fake listing's one live interactive
 *     row.
 *   - **lane-2 (the control)**: session `conveyor-9402`, NO `workerSession`/`ownerSession` recorded at all (a
 *     genuinely dead lease — no owning session to check) — must still reap exactly as before this fix, proving
 *     the fix changes nothing for the population it isn't for.
 *
 * RED (pre-fix): lane-1 IS in `wouldReap` (`reason: 'session-gone'`) — its live owner is invisible to the
 * pre-fix code, which only ever looked up the lease's own `session` name. Lane-2 is ALSO reaped (unaffected).
 * GREEN (post-fix): lane-1 is NOT reaped (stays `kept` — `ownerAlive` wins). Lane-2 IS STILL reaped (no
 * regression on a genuinely dead, unowned lease).
