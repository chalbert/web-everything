/**
 * @file breaks/promote-draft-blocked-by-stale-clone-and-silent.mjs — live incident 2026-10-03 (~17:55Z): PR #3806,
 * the fix for main's red CI, sat green-but-draft for 15+ minutes and was never promoted, so it was never reviewed.
 *
 * ROOT CAUSE (two defects, both reproduced here):
 *  1. The fix-dispatch daemon's promote half (`promote-draft-pr-dispatch.mjs`) called `assertMainNotStale` with no
 *     dispatch path, so a MANAGED daemon clone that was merely 2 commits behind `origin/main` made the guard
 *     throw for the WHOLE pass, every tick. The clone was held behind by a slow rebuild smoke and its tree was
 *     dirty, so the last-good fallback did not apply either. Neither commit touched any file the promote pass
 *     imports (only `scripts/operations/cli-adapter.mjs`), and the pass's only write is `gh pr ready` after a
 *     fresh per-sha re-check. A green draft stayed draft; since main was red, nothing could land to unblock it.
 *  2. The failure was invisible. `onTick` skipped every `tick-failed` refusal as "already printed by the per-repo
 *     loop", but that loop reads only the FIX half's repo errors. Promote outcomes had no log line at all.
 *
 * FIX: `isPromoteCodePath` (the pass's own import closure) is passed as `dispatchPath`, so lag outside it is
 * tolerated; the promote half's tick failure is named and printed; promoted drafts are logged.
 *
 * SCENARIO (no simulator; real git, real modules from `sourceRoot`):
 *   A. a managed clone (WE_DAEMON_MANAGED_CLONE=1) is 1 commit behind its origin, the commit touching only
 *      `scripts/operations/cli-adapter.mjs`; the promote pass runs from it with a planned green draft and a fake
 *      `gh pr ready` — the draft must be promoted;
 *   B. a daemon tick whose promote half throws must produce a log line naming the promote half and its reason.
