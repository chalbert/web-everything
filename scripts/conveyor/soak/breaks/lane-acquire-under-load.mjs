/**
 * @file breaks/lane-acquire-under-load.mjs — live break 4, 2026-09-24 incident (#3383, card 4069 -> #4069).
 * `scripts/lane-pool.mjs`'s `cmdAcquire` auto-pick loop (no explicit `--lane=N`) used to recompute the FULL
 * dirty/ahead probe pipeline (`git status --porcelain` + `rev-list` + patch-equivalence, via
 * `effectiveDirtyOrAhead`) for EVERY unleased lane, FROM SCRATCH, on EVERY `ACQUIRE_POLL_MS` (1s) poll tick, IN
 * EVERY concurrent caller — so `--wait-ms=<W>` bounded only the gaps BETWEEN full rescans, never a rescan
 * itself. Live: one real `acquire --wait-ms=30000` took ~6 minutes and still failed while the pool actually had
 * spare capacity (`lane-pool-health-watch.mjs --dry-run` read 14-15 acquirable at the same moment).
 *
 * Fix: b6c6dee34 (card 4069 -> #4069, epic #3383) — auto-pick now consumes `acquirableListCached`, the SAME
 * single-flight, cached, `--scan-timeout-ms`-bounded scan `list --acquirable` already shares across concurrent
 * callers (#4012), instead of an independent uncached rescan per caller per poll tick. Live proof in that
 * commit: 3 concurrent `--wait-ms=8000` callers on a saturated pool went from 27.60s to 9.09s. Pinned unit
 * proof: `scripts/__tests__/lane-pool-acquire-shares-scan-cache.test.mjs`.
 *
 * SCENARIO (built per this task's brief): a larger pool (`LANES`), every lane made genuinely dirty (a real
 * uncommitted change to a TRACKED file, `.gitignore` — never an untracked scratch file, which
 * `lib/lane-litter.mjs`'s known-safe-litter allowlist would forgive and read as clean), a slow-`git` PATH shim
 * ahead of the real one (`SLOW_GIT_S` extra per git child — the SAME technique
 * `lane-pool-acquire-shares-scan-cache.test.mjs`'s own third case uses: a real local `git status`/`rev-list`
 * over a handful of tiny lanes is a few tens of ms, too fast on modern hardware to reliably blow a
 * several-second bound on its own), `CALLERS` concurrent REAL `node <simClone>/scripts/lane-pool.mjs acquire
 * --wait-ms=<WAIT_MS> --json` child processes (as review/fix sessions do — real dispatched sessions acquire
 * concurrently, `we:scripts/conveyor/__tests__/sim/agent-actions.mjs#acquireLane`), with exactly ONE lane
 * un-dirtied (freed) once the callers' first shared scan has provably read it dirty (soak-main-red — see
 * perRound), so there is a legitimate winner the pool must notice mid-wait. `api.violation('bounded',
 * ...)` fires when any call takes longer than `WAIT_MS + BOUND_MARGIN_MS`, or fails with a scan-timeout message
 * while a lane was, at some point, genuinely free (the OTHER shape the pinned unit test's third case pins).
 *
 * STATUS (2026-09-25, measured by this harness): STILL BROKEN ON MAIN AT LIVE SCALE — card we:backlog/4172.
 * At the 6-lane/3-caller shape every run was green on main AND on the pre-fix code (`red-green.mjs --at-parent`
 * restores lane-pool.mjs to b6c6dee34^: all callers inside the bound) — too small to tell the two apart. At
 * 14 lanes / 5 callers (now the default) current main returns 33s, 34s, 45s, 56s, 68s for `--wait-ms=20000` —
 * waiters give up one after another ~11s apart, the last at 3.4x its wait — while the pre-fix code returned all
 * five at ~34s in the same world. So b6c6dee34 fixed the 6-minute rescan storm but the wait is still no bound
 * under concurrency. `fixPresent` therefore probes for the NEXT fix (none yet → expected-fail); whoever fixes
 * 4172 replaces the probe with a marker their fix adds. `SOAK_LOAD_LANES` / `SOAK_LOAD_CALLERS` override the
 * scale.
 *
 * RED-GREEN CAVEAT — READ BEFORE RE-RUNNING `red-green.mjs` ON THIS BREAK (use `--at-parent`). Reverse-applying b6c6dee34's own
 * `scripts/lane-pool.mjs` hunk onto the CURRENT tree does not apply, even narrowed to just that one file
 * (verified: `git apply -R --3way` reports "repository lacks the necessary blob to perform 3-way merge...
 * patch does not apply" at exactly the `cmdAcquire` auto-pick hunk, `@@ -1538,21 +1516,55 @@`). Root cause:
 * `cmdAcquire`'s auto-pick loop has been rewritten SEVERAL times since 2026-09-24 by later, unrelated commits
 * layered on top (growth-on-empty, `holderSlug`/`acquirePollCount` instrumentation, …) — the patch's context no
 * longer matches, and `red-green.mjs`'s throwaway copy is a single fresh commit with no object history for a
 * real 3-way reconstruction. `git diff`'s path filter (`--paths`) selects whole FILES, not sub-file hunks, so
 * no narrower `--paths` choice fixes a context mismatch INSIDE the one file that has it — there is no subset
 * of paths that both (a) contains the fix and (b) reverse-applies cleanly. This is a tooling limitation of
 * reverse-applying an 8-revision-old commit onto a function since rewritten by later work, not a defect in
 * this scenario file; `fixPresent` below still correctly reports the fix IS present on this tree (confirmed:
 * `acquirableListCached` appears inside `cmdAcquire`'s body). See this task's final report for the exact
 * command/output evidence.
