/**
 * @file breaks/small-pr-lands-over-large-in-review.mjs — #4308 (land-time complement of #4295; ratified
 * decision #4307 Fork 1 A; live incident 2026-09-27, PR #2821/#2826 — see backlog #4308's own "Evidence").
 *
 * LIVE INCIDENT (recap). #2821 (`lane/fix-procedure`, 20 files, +1807/-118) sat in review while smaller PRs
 * touching the SAME files landed under it: #2826 merged (touching `we:scripts/conveyor/review-status-tag.mjs`)
 * while #2821 was mid-review, immediately conflicting it (`merge-status:conflicting`) — a fixer round, a full
 * CI run and a fresh review round, twice in one day. Nothing at LAND time looked at overlap between an
 * already-open, in-review PR and a smaller ready one; #4295 only coordinates DISPATCH through the daemons' own
 * claim stores, and #2821/#2826 were orchestrator-dispatched (never went through them).
 *
 * FIX: `we:scripts/conveyor/land-overlap-yield.mjs` (`overlapYieldWaits`), wired into
 * `we:scripts/merge-ai-prs.mjs#planLabelDrain` as one more `waitOn` source (`overlap-yield:#<pr>`) — a ready PR
 * X HOLDS for a bounded, non-renewable window (settings-driven, `we:scripts/drain-overlap-yield-config.json`,
 * on by default) while a LARGER PR Y sharing a changed file is open, in review, on the same base.
 *
 * SCENARIO (two, per backlog #4308's own Test plan item 3): the real `drain` pass daemon
 * (`sim/daemon-host.mjs#PASS_DAEMONS.drain` — the real `scripts/merge-ai-prs.mjs --label=ready-to-merge`
 * spawned once per tick) against the fake GitHub. Large PR L and small PR S both touch `overlap/shared.md`; S
 * opens `ready-to-merge` + `review:accepted` (an automation-authored `reviewed-sha` marker for its head); L
 * opens `review:pending` only (never ready). Both scenarios observe the COMPUTED `mergeStateStatus` from the
 * fake GitHub (never the label) — the same up-to-date rule the live incident actually hit.
 *   (i) L LANDS WITHIN THE WINDOW: at round 2 (well inside the 45-minute default window — 3 sim-minutes/round),
 *       L's review clears (`review:pending` → `ready-to-merge` + `review:accepted`, mirroring a human `/review`
 *       accept). RED (pre-#4308): the drain lands S on tick 1, oblivious to L — when L is later cleared it
 *       reads BEHIND (`large-pr-conflicted`). GREEN: S defers (`overlap-yield:#<L>`) until L lands clean, then
 *       S is released and lands too — S's own resulting conflict, if any, is a separate, allowed cost.
 *   (ii) BUDGET RUNS OUT: L never clears review for the whole run (16+ rounds, 45+ sim-minutes). RED: S lands on
 *       tick 1 exactly as if L did not exist (no yield mechanism to observe at all — vacuous, not a pass).
 *       GREEN: S defers, then is RELEASED once its own budget elapses and lands anyway — L becoming CONFLICTING
 *       afterwards (main having moved) is the documented, accepted cost (#4308 "What it does and does not buy").
 * A `scenario-ran` check (in `judge`) requires BOTH branches to have actually exercised the yield (an
 * `overlap-yield:` log line observed), never just "eventually merged" — that alone would also be true, coincidentally, with the feature entirely absent.
 *
 * BASELINE (RED, pre-#4308): `origin/main` at 9f7dd3d3e (2026-09-28, "drain: mark card 4371 resolved on land"),
 * this break's own two files (this module + its `.soak.test.mjs`) applied with NO other #4308 change —
 * `node scripts/conveyor/soak/run.mjs break small-pr-lands-over-large-in-review` exits 1 on both scenarios
 * (`large-pr-conflicted` on (i); `vacuous` on (ii), since the mechanism does not exist yet to observe).
