 * @file scripts/conveyor/reconcile-fix-dispatch.mjs
 * @description #3438 — DISPATCH THE FIX AGENT `we:scripts/conveyor/reconcile-pass.mjs` DECIDES IS OWED.
 *
 * THE GAP THIS CLOSES. `reconcile-pass.mjs` (#3296) already decides, correctly, that a bounced (`review:changes`)
 * PR with a real finding, an unspent attempt cap, and nothing live working it OWES a fix (`kind: 'fix'`) — but it
 * "DISPATCHES NOTHING ITSELF" (its own docblock), and nothing has ever called that decision for the `fix` kind.
 * `we:scripts/conveyor/tick-core.mjs#planFixSpawns` looks like the same job but is NOT: it only ever considers a
 * PR in `state.prs` whose `num` is in `launchedNums` — i.e. a PR THIS conveyor session's own bookkeeping launched
 * and still remembers. `reconcile-pass.mjs` is keyed by PR number alone and reads live `gh`/`claude agents` state
 * fresh every pass, so it also covers a bounced PR this specific conveyor process never launched (a restart lost
 * the memory of, one a sibling process launched, one opened by hand) — the two are genuinely different
 * populations, not a duplicate mechanism (see the item's own "Scope, narrowed in light of #3332" section for the
 * question this file answers: YES, genuinely different, so (b) applies — wire it).
 *
 * WHY THIS IS ITS OWN FILE, NOT A DETOUR THROUGH `we:scripts/operations/dispatch-lane.mjs`'s OWN `--num=` CLI.
 * That CLI resolves ONE launch by finding `num` inside `planTick`'s five lists (`decisions.spawnFixes` among
 * them) — a `reconcile-pass.mjs` fix entry will NEVER appear there, for the exact reason above, so `--num=`
 * would find nothing to dispatch no matter what `num` is passed. This file does not re-derive `dispatch-lane`'s
 * policy, though — it REUSES its actual fill/dispatch primitives verbatim (`we:scripts/operations/
 * dispatch-lane.mjs#fillBrief` + `#BRIEF_REQUIRED_BY_KIND.fix` + `#sessionSlugFor`, `we:scripts/operations/
 * dispatch-lane-io.mjs#buildAgentArgv` + `#defaultSpawnAgent` + `#findItem`/`#defaultLoadItems`) — the same
 * "the corrected fillBrief token set... however it resolves the scope-refusal question" this item's own text
 * asks for, not a bespoke fill/dispatch path. The shape this file itself follows — plan → fill the brief → mint a
 * session id → spawn, with no lane pre-acquired by the dispatcher (the agent's own brief step 1 acquires its
 * own) — mirrors `we:scripts/operations/review-dispatch.mjs#dispatchReview` (#3279) closely, because that is the
 * existing, already-landed precedent for "dispatch directly against a PR number, outside `planTick`'s own
 * launch lists".
 *
 * THE ONE THING `dispatchReview` DOES NOT NEED THAT THIS FILE DOES: A LANE NUMBER. `{{LANE}}` is baked into
 * `we:skills-src/conveyor/fix-agent-brief.md`'s own acquire line (`--lane={{LANE}}`) — unlike
 * `we:skills-src/review/review-agent-brief.md`'s lane-less `acquire` (no `--lane=` at all, so the pool auto-picks
 * one) — because that brief is SHARED with `dispatch-lane.mjs`'s own tick-core-driven fix dispatch, which DOES
 * pre-assign a specific lane from `decisions.spawnFixes[].lane`. Rather than fork the brief (twin templates for
 * the same job is exactly the drift risk `we:scripts/conveyor/review-session-slug.mjs`'s own header warns about
 * for a slug function), this file reads a currently-free lane NUMBER at dispatch time — the SAME
 * `lane-pool.mjs list --acquirable --json` read `we:scripts/conveyor/tick-core.mjs`'s own IO shell uses to build
 * `freeLanes` for `planFixSpawns` — and fills `{{LANE}}` with it. This is a READ, not a lock: the dispatched
 * agent still does the real `acquire` itself in its own brief step 1, and can lose the race to a sibling exactly
 * as any other dispatch already can (`we:skills-src/conveyor/delivery-agent-brief.md`'s own step 1: "If that lane
 * lost its race to a sibling, `acquire` fails loud — report it and exit").
 *
 * DOUBLE-DISPATCH GUARD: NAME-BASED LIVENESS, NOT A SEPARATE LEDGER. This file keeps no bookkeeping of its own
 * between passes (deliberately — see `reconcile-pass.mjs`'s own "session-ephemeral" argument against folding into
 * the tick). The guard against re-dispatching a fix that is already running is `reconcile-core.mjs#bindAgents`'s
 * OWN liveness read: it now recognizes a live `fix-<pr>` session by name (#3438, mirroring the `review-<pr>`
 * name-bind #3437 already added) and refuses (`live-process`) before `planReconcile` ever returns a `kind:'fix'`
 * dispatch entry for that PR again. This is exactly `review-dispatch.mjs`'s own safety net — it carries no
 * separate in-flight ledger either.
 *
 * A ONE-SHOT PASS, LIKE ITS SIBLINGS. Read `reconcile-pass.mjs`'s plan, dispatch every `kind:'fix'` entry it
 * offers, report, exit. Wired into `we:skills-src/conveyor/runner.mjs`'s mechanical passes (#3438) alongside
 * infra-blocked recovery / the lease-reaper / the session-reaper / the hiccup sink — best-effort, never gating
 * the tick.

 * we:scripts/conveyor/reconcile-fix-dispatch.mjs#planFixesFromReconcile — PURE (the one impurity is calling the
 * INJECTED `resolveFallbackScope`, exactly the same idiom `findItemFn` already uses — a real caller hands in a
 * function that does IO, a test hands in a stub, and this function itself still touches no `fs`/`gh`/`git`
 * directly). Narrow `reconcile-pass.mjs`'s `kind:'fix'` dispatch entries down to the ones this file can actually
 * act on, and NAME why each one it drops cannot be (mirroring `reconcile-core.mjs`'s own REFUSAL_KINDS
 * discipline: a refusal a reader cannot audit is exactly the defect this whole chain exists to remove).
 *
 * THINGS CAN MAKE AN OTHERWISE-OWED FIX UNDISPATCHABLE, BOTH NAMED (the `no-item-num` refusal `#3634` documented
 * here previously is GONE as of #xmtbdgs multi-repo slice 6 — an item-less PR is attributed to the PR itself
 * instead, per the ratified `#conveyor-multi-repo-model` clause 3; see the loop body below):
 *   `no-scope`     — EITHER the item number resolves but the backlog loader has no scope for it (an item
 *     scaffolded with no `scope:` frontmatter; an UNRESOLVABLE number — deleted/ghost card — is refused outright
 *     and never reaches the fallback — measured live #3634: EVERY currently-open `kind:'fix'` entry
 *     whose item number resolves hits this, epics included, e.g. `#2220` on `lane/3383-host-process-granularity`
 *     resolving epic `#3383`, which — correctly — carries no file-level `scope:` of its own) OR the PR names no
 *     item at all AND its own diff is empty too (slice 6, rare — an item-less PR that changed nothing). Both
 *     have the SAME safe fallback: {@link resolveFallbackScope} (item-carrying) / {@link resolvePrWorkUnit}'s
 *     own diff read (item-less) may return the PR's OWN already-changed files (repo-prefixed) as the fence
 *     instead. This is never a LOOSER fence than a declared `scope:` would have been — a fix agent can only
 *     touch what this PR already touches — so it is safe exactly where a declared scope is unknown. Only when
 *     the fallback ALSO comes back empty does this remain `no-scope`, mirroring `dispatch-lane.mjs`'s OWN
 *     scope-refusal (`itemScope.length` check) for exactly the same reason: a fix agent with no fence at all is

/**
 * we:scripts/conveyor/reconcile-fix-dispatch.mjs#tryResumeFix — `#xu2krte` Fork 1: RESUME-OR-NOTHING, gated to
 * `planned.isConflict` ONLY, and — `#xazl9u3` — DELIBERATELY LANE-FREE. This is the resume-candidate check
 * itself, not a peek at one: it is the whole reason {@link runReconcileFixDispatch} can afford to check "will
 * this entry actually need a lane" BEFORE ever popping one from the free-lane pool. A conflict-caused bounce
 * that successfully resumes its original session uses NO lane at all — the original bug (#xazl9u3, filed
 * against PR #1966's own independent review) was that `runReconcileFixDispatch` popped a lane for EVERY planned
 * fix regardless, including this one, wasting it for nothing whenever a resume succeeded. Calling this function
 * first, and only falling through to a real `dispatchFix` (which DOES need a lane) when it reports `resumed:
 * false`, is the fix: a successful resume never removes a lane number from the pool in the first place.
 *
 * When the planned entry is a conflict-caused bounce (Fork 2/4's `merge-status:conflicting` label still present
 * at plan time) AND {@link findResumeCandidate} finds a still-listed original-builder session, this attempts
 * `buildAgentArgv({resumeSessionId})` — a bare `claude --bg --resume <id>` with no other flag, per that
 * function's own docblock and the live build-time probe backing it
 * (`docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#parked-pr-conflict-dispatched-not-scripted`). The outcome is checked
 * against a FRESH `claude agents --json --all` read ({@link resumeSucceeded}): a genuine resume returns
 * immediately (the resumed session already has the new work); anything else (the CLI forked a copy — observed
 * both when the original session was still "already running" per its own bookkeeping, and whenever the request
 * carried any flag besides `--resume`, though this call passes none) gets its accidental copy `claude stop`-ped
 * ({@link stopSession} — never a bare `kill`, per `#3383`'s own hard-won lesson), and the caller falls through
 * to a fresh dispatch (which DOES pop a lane) exactly as every other (non-conflict, or non-resumable) entry
 * already does.
 *
 * TWO HARDENINGS ADDED BY THE INDEPENDENT REVIEW OF PR #1966 (both real, both fixed here rather than merely
 * filed, because both sit on this exact security/correctness-critical dispatch surface):
 *
 * (1) OWNERSHIP CHECK BEFORE TRUSTING A CANDIDATE — TWO INDEPENDENT signals, both required (hardened again by
 * a SECOND review pass on PR #1966, which found the first cut's single HEAD-sha check alone was not enough:
 * two DIFFERENT lanes/PRs can share an identical HEAD commit, e.g. a lane freshly branched from another lane's
 * tip before either advances). `findResumeCandidate` alone only proves a session with the stamped id is STILL
 * LISTED — not that it actually belongs to THIS pr. A PR body's `authored-by-actor` stamp is plain, editable
 * text, visible in every other open PR's body too, so a forged/copied stamp could redirect a genuine conflict
 * fix into an unrelated LIVE session, injecting a false task into it. This mirrors exactly the binding problem
 * `reconcile-core.mjs#bindAgents` already solves for liveness with its OWN two-path union ("a union of weak
 * proxies raises confidence; either one ALONE does not") — reused here, not re-invented:
 *   (a) HEAD-SHA — {@link resolveLaneHead} (`reconcile-pass.mjs`) reads the candidate's own `cwd`'s real git
 *       `HEAD`, and it must equal `planned.headRefOid` (the PR's own head sha, threaded through by
 *       {@link planFixesFromReconcile}).
 *   (b) NAME — the candidate's own session `name` (assigned by whichever dispatcher started it, never
 *       attacker-controlled via a PR-body edit) must be one THIS pr's real original builder could legitimately
 *       carry: `conveyor-<itemNum>` (an ordinary build) or `fix-<pr>` (a prior fix-dispatch being resumed
 *       again) — `sessionSlugFor`'s own two relevant conventions, not a new naming scheme.
 * BOTH must hold. A mismatch on either (or an unresolvable `cwd`) is treated exactly like "no candidate" — no
 * resume attempt, no `stop`, straight to a fresh dispatch — because nothing was touched, there is nothing to
 * undo.
 *
 * (2) BOUNDED RETRY ON THE POST-RESUME LISTING READ. `#3331`'s own research already documents that
 * `claude agents --json` can lag the CLI's real state. A single, immediate post-spawn read could therefore miss
 * a listing update for a resume that genuinely succeeded, misreading it as a fork and `stop`-ping the very
 * session that was just handed new work. `resumeSucceeded` is re-checked up to
 * {@link RESUME_CONFIRM_MAX_ATTEMPTS} times with a short `wait` between attempts before this function concludes
 * "not resumed" — the same shape `#3331`'s own probe methodology already used (repeat rather than trust one
 * sample), just applied at dispatch time instead of at probe time.
 *
 * (3) `resumeSucceeded` HAS NO POSITIVE FALLBACK FOR A MISSING `id` (`#3541`, follow-up from PR #1966's
 * independent review — see that function's own docblock for the full story). Two candidate fallbacks were
 * built and both were found unsafe by independent review, the second time backed by a live measurement: a
 * fresh session's row can take far longer to appear in `claude agents --json --all` than any retry budget this
 * synchronous call site can afford (26+ seconds observed, against a ~600ms total retry window here). An `id`
 * match failing therefore still resolves `resumed:false` here, exactly as before `#3541` — the safe direction,
 * argued in `resumeSucceeded`'s own docblock: a false stop costs a wasted attempt and a redundant fresh
 * dispatch (recoverable), a false resume would silently drop the real work and leave a forked session
 * unmanaged (not recoverable without a person noticing). What DID change: `resumeSucceeded` now surfaces an
 * `anomaly` diagnostic when this never-yet-observed shape is actually hit, so it is visible on the record
 * (threaded onto the returned `resumeAttempt` below) rather than indistinguishable from an ordinary fork.
 * @param {{itemNum:string, pr:number, laneRef:string, scope:string[], isConflict?:boolean, body?:string|null, headRefOid?:string|null}} planned -
 *   NOTE: deliberately no `lane` field — this runs before one is ever assigned.
 * @param {object} [o]

 * resume. Mirrors `we:scripts/operations/review-dispatch.mjs#dispatchReview`'s own composition (plan → fill →
 * mint a fresh session id → spawn), reusing `dispatch-lane.mjs`'s real fill/dispatch primitives rather than this
 * file's own copies. Requires `planned.lane` — the caller ({@link runReconcileFixDispatch}) only calls this
 * AFTER popping one from the free-lane pool, which by construction only happens once {@link tryResumeFix} (when
 * relevant) has already reported `resumed: false` — see that function's own `#xazl9u3` docblock for why.
 *
 * IT PASSES THE DISPATCHED-AGENT SYSTEM PROMPT (#3606/#xqyyoje/#xy8di3v), AND UNTIL 2026-09-11 IT DID NOT —
 * the one dispatch path in the repo that was missing it. `createDispatchSinks` has always passed
 * `DISPATCHED_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_FILE` (so the tick-core-driven fix dispatch was covered) and
 * `review-dispatch.mjs` passes its own review-side twin (#xy8di3v). THIS function passed none, so a fix agent
 * dispatched by the reconcile pass met `fix-agent-brief.md` with nothing telling it the brief was real.
 *
 * The brief opens with *"**This is a TEMPLATE, not a runnable skill.**"* and keeps `{{PLACEHOLDERS}}` /
 * `{{LIKE_THIS}}` in its own explanatory prose (both legitimately unsubstituted — `fillBrief` reports them as
 * non-fatal unknown tokens by design), so a genuinely, correctly filled brief still READS as an unfilled
 * template. LIVE-CONFIRMED 3/3 on 2026-09-11: `fix-2127`, `fix-2130` and `fix-2003` each received a fully
 * substituted 16.5 KB brief naming their real PR — and each self-aborted with *"I don't see an actual task or
 * question in your message — just the fix-agent brief template (#2630) itself"*, doing no work at all. That is
 * exactly the #3606 failure `review-1998/2024/2027` hit on the review side, recurring on the one path the
 * remedy had never been wired into. The delivery-side file is the right one here (not the review twin): a fix
 * agent IS a `dispatch-lane`-shaped delivery agent — it acquires a lane, works an item, pushes to a PR.

 * we:scripts/conveyor/reconcile-fix-dispatch.mjs#runReconcileFixDispatch — the WHOLE pass: read
 * `reconcile-pass.mjs`'s plan (reused, not re-run by hand), narrow it to dispatchable fixes
 * ({@link planFixesFromReconcile}), and for each — `#xazl9u3` — try a lane-free resume FIRST, only assigning a
 * currently-free lane and running a full fresh dispatch when that resume attempt does not pan out. Read-then-
 * act, exactly like its siblings; a failure dispatching ONE entry is reported and does not stop the rest.
 *
 * `#xazl9u3` — WHY THE ORDER MATTERS. The bug this fixed: this loop used to pop a lane for EVERY planned entry
 * unconditionally, before ever asking whether the entry would actually use one — including a conflict-caused
 * entry that goes on to resume its original session and touches no lane at all. In a tick where free lanes are
 * scarce, that wasted one for nothing (self-correcting next tick, since {@link freeLaneNumbers} re-reads the
 * pool fresh, but still a real waste in the meantime). Calling {@link tryResumeFix} BEFORE `lanes.shift()` means
 * a successful resume returns straight into `dispatched` and `continue`s to the next entry having never touched
 * `lanes` — the pool is left exactly as {@link pickFreeLanes} produced it for every entry that resolves via
 * resume.
 *
 * #x33jgwt (multi-repo slice 5) — THE REPO GATE LIVES HERE, ON CAPABILITY, NOT IDENTITY
 * (`docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#conveyor-multi-repo-model` clause 1). This function reads `repo`'s profile
 * ONCE and asks two INDEPENDENT questions of it — `fix` and `ci-heal` are separate stages/capabilities, each
 * with its own on/off switch, not one "is this repo supported at all" bit:
 *   - `!profile.capabilities.fix` → this whole pass is a no-op for the repo: every `fix` entry `reconcile-pass`
 *     offered is recorded `unsupported-repo` (never touching the lane pool or a dispatch sink), exactly as
 *     EVERY non-WE repo behaved before this slice. Only `we` was ever missing this bit before; frontierui and
 *     plateau-app both flip it on in `repo-profile.mjs` as part of this same slice, so in practice this branch
 *     is only reachable today via an injected `resolveProfile` (see below) — a real, un-injected call never
 *     takes it for a real constellation repo, but the check itself must stay capability-shaped so the NEXT repo
 *     this constellation ever grows (with `fix` genuinely off) is refused for the right reason, not silently
 *     let through because it happens to resolve to *some* profile.
 *   - `!profile.capabilities.ciHeal` → independently of the above, any `ci-heal` entry in the SAME
 *     `reconcile-pass` reading is recorded `unsupported-repo` too (CI-heal was its own stage, held off `fix`'s
 *     switch, until multi-repo slice 7, `we:backlog/3967-*.md`, turned it on for frontierui/plateau-app too —
 *     both now resolve `ciHeal: true` in `repo-profile.mjs`, so a real call takes this branch only via an
 *     injected `resolveProfile` reporting it off, same as the `fix` branch above). This file dispatches no
 *     `ci-heal` itself EITHER WAY — that is `we:scripts/operations/ci-heal-pr-dispatch.mjs
 *     #runReconcileCiHealDispatch`'s own job, reading this SAME `reconcile-pass` output — so when the
 *     capability is on, a `ci-heal` entry is simply absent from both `dispatched` and `refusals` here (that
 *     other file is where it is acted on, or refused). Recording the refusal HERE only when the capability is
 *     off preserves the exact visibility the pre-slice-5 blanket branch gave every non-WE repo's ci-heal
 *     population, now scoped to its own capability instead of riding on `fix`'s.
 * Both checks read the SAME `profile`, computed once, never re-derived per entry or per kind.
