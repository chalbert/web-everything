/**
 * xpinskip (epic #4075/#3383) — a daemon whose EVERY recent tick refused dispatch because its clone is behind
 * origin/main ("the dispatching checkout is N commit(s) behind origin/main — refusing to dispatch"), for more
 * than `minDurationMs` (10 min).
 *
 * Live 2026-09-26 23:39 ET: a conflicting pinned overlay (#2768) made the rebuild refuse every tick, the
 * `wev-review-daemon` clone fell 2 commits behind, and the fix daemon refused ALL dispatch in all three repos,
 * silently, tick after tick. `daemon-owed-no-dispatch` needs owed work and 30 min; `clone-stale` only reads the
 * rebuild's own alert kinds; neither named it. This sign reads only the daemon's own log (a trailing streak of
 * ticks tagged `s` by `health-watch-core.mjs#foldDaemonMemory`) and, when the self-sync probe ran, names the
 * rebuild's latest blocking alert so the episode says WHY the clone is behind.
 *
 * `notifyEvenInShadow: true` — the same posture as `daemon-held-on-last-good`: a fleet silently refusing all
 * dispatch is exactly what shadow mode's notify-suppression must not swallow.
