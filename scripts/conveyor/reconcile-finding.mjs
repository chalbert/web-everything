/**
 * @file scripts/conveyor/reconcile-finding.mjs
 * @description POST A SEQUENCING / CROSS-CUTTING-CONCERN FINDING from a mechanical or reconciliation agent —
 *   a rebase agent, a branch-sync pass, or anything doing cross-PR work that notices a PR conflicts with a
 *   decision made ELSEWHERE in the repo, a class of concern `we:scripts/operations/review-pr.mjs`'s correctness/
 *   security pass never checks for (it reviews a diff's own internal correctness, not whether landing it now is
 *   well-sequenced against a sibling decision on `main`).
 *
 * THE MOTIVATING INCIDENT (2026-09-05). While rebasing PR #1920 onto current `main`, an agent found that
 * `main`'s own resolution of a sibling item (`#2412`) had DELIBERATELY DEFERRED the exact feature #1920 builds
 * (`blockedBy: ["2410"]`, because nothing writes `redteam:accepted` to a live PR yet). #1920 builds that feature
 * anyway, unaware of the deferral — landing it as-is would introduce a hard-block on every engine-tier PR with no
 * way to satisfy it. That is a real, correctness-adjacent finding, but the independent `review-pr` pass would
 * never surface it (see above), and the rebase agent had no way to post it ON THE PR — only in its own private
 * task summary, so the operator had to ask twice before learning the concern existed at all.
 *
 * WHY THIS IS NOT A NEW LABEL OR A NEW COMMENT SCHEME (operator correction, same night, superseding an earlier
 * draft of this file that DID invent a bespoke `hold:sequencing` label). The right target for "this PR must not
 * land as-is" already exists and is already load-bearing: `review:changes`, applied through the SINGLE HOME of a
 * review-label swap, `we:scripts/review-set-label.mjs#runReviewLabelCli`. Reusing it, rather than adding a
 * parallel hold, buys three things for free:
 *   1. It is an ALREADY-UNDERSTOOD signal. The drain already refuses `ready-to-merge` on `review:changes`
 *      (`decideSetLabel`'s own `changes` branch strips `READY_TO_MERGE_LABEL`), exactly like any other bounce —
 *      no new drain-side rule was needed.
 *   2. It ROUTES INTO THE EXISTING FIX→RE-REVIEW CYCLE. `we:scripts/conveyor/reconcile-fix-dispatch.mjs` (#3438,
 *      wired into `we:skills-src/conveyor/runner.mjs`'s mechanical passes) already scans every open PR each tick
 *      and auto-dispatches a fix agent for a `review:changes` PR with a real finding and nothing live working it
 *      — so a finding posted THIS way is picked up by the normal automated bounce-and-fix loop, not a bespoke
 *      pathway only this file's caller knows about.
 *   3. It CANNOT be used to self-approve or bypass review. `decideSetLabel({ to: 'changes' })` never emits
 *      `review:accepted` and never removes `review:human` — a bounce lands nothing, ever, by construction in the
 *      pure core this file has no way to route around (this file pins `fixedTo: 'changes'`; nothing here can
 *      reach `accepted` or `clear-human`, both refused unless a proven-independent human/session clears them).
 *      Same spirit as `review:human` never being agent-clearable (#2844/#2895).
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE ACTUALLY ADDS, THEN — NOT A NEW MECHANISM, A DECLARED, EASY-TO-REACH SHAPE FOR ONE CALLER. Any
 * agent invoking `we:scripts/review-set-label.mjs` directly for this purpose would need to independently
 * discover: that `--to=changes` requires `--body-file`; where a body file may legally live (`checkBodyFileLocation`
 * / `bodyFileRoots`); and that a hand-written body (no rendered `### Findings (N)` heading) is exempt from the
 * #3334 reasonless-bounce guard by design, so a prose finding never needs to fake that heading. This file is a
 * THIN SHIM — the exact shape `we:scripts/conveyor/rearm-review.mjs` already uses for the sibling `rearm` target
 * — that folds those facts into one obvious call so a reconciliation agent mid-task reaches this in one command:
 *   `node we:scripts/conveyor/reconcile-finding.mjs <pr> --body-file=<path to the write-up> [--repo=<owner/name>]
 *      [--agent=<calling agent/task name>] [--channel=<surface>]`
 * `--repo` is OPTIONAL — a reconciliation agent typically runs inside the PR's own lane clone, so a missing
 * `--repo` derives from `cwd` (`repoOptional: true`, same as `rearm-review.mjs`). Only `decideSetLabel`, the
 * comment banner below, and the default actor/channel differ from the shared harness; every invariant (INVARIANT
 * 2, the self-clear refusal, the size guard, the OPEN-state gate) is inherited unchanged from
 * `runReviewLabelCli`.
 *
 * THE COMMENT IS DELIBERATELY LABELLED AS A DIFFERENT KIND OF FINDING FROM A REVIEW VERDICT. It still renders
 * through `buildVerdictComment` (so it gets the SAME marker-forgery render boundary every other verdict comment
 * gets — free text in this file's `--body-file` is neutralized exactly like a reviewer's write-up is), but the
 * body is prefixed with {@link RECONCILE_FINDING_BANNER}, so a reader — human or the fix-dispatch agent that
 * picks this PR up next — sees immediately that this bounce came from a mechanical/reconciliation pass raising a
 * SEQUENCING concern, not from the correctness/security review path.
 *
 * NO AUTO-CLEAR. Unlike `we:scripts/conveyor/parked-pr-conflict-watch.mjs`'s `merge-status:conflicting` label
 * (which self-heals the moment the underlying `mergeable` state changes), a sequencing conflict against a
 * sibling decision has no single mechanically-correct resolution — clearing it means a human or an agent judging
 * the sequencing question, deciding whether to rebase around it, wait for the blocker, or re-scope the PR. That
 * judgment is exactly what `review:changes` already exists to park behind, and clearing it takes the same
 * `--to=accepted` (or a fix + `rearm`) path as any other bounce — never something this file can do itself.
