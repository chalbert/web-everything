/**
 * @file scripts/conveyor/parked-pr-conflict-watch.mjs
 * @description The PARKED-PR CONFLICT WATCH (`#xw0odtv`) — a standing, mechanical pass that catches an open,
 *   review-parked PR (`review:human` / `review:pending` / an uncleared `review:changes`) drifting into a REAL
 *   merge conflict against `main` while nobody is actively looking at it, and makes that impossible to miss.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Live incident, WE PR #1920: opened parked under `review:human` (a gate-self/statute edit —
 * the conflict-of-interest label), `main` advanced 16 merge commits including one other #2412 sub-slice
 * touching the SAME file, and the PR silently went `mergeable: CONFLICTING` / `mergeStateStatus: DIRTY`. The
 * operator discovered it only by chance, about to clear the `review:human` gate. Traced every existing sweep
 * that reads `mergeable`: `we:scripts/merge-ai-prs.mjs`'s `classifyPr` computes it but a `skip` verdict for a
 * non-rebase-drop-eligible PR is silently discarded (`continue`, no comment, no label);
 * `we:scripts/conveyor/pr-watch.mjs`'s `EXIT_PARKED` is a ONE-SHOT poll that exits the instant a PR first parks
 * and never resumes; `we:scripts/conveyor/branch-drift.mjs` (#3464) watches exactly one named long-lived
 * branch, not the population of open PRs; `#2824` (`we:backlog/2824-launch-agnostic-freshness-gate-any-open-pr-
 * behind-main.md`, still `status: open`) is the closest prior art but is deliberately scoped to
 * `mergeStateStatus === 'BEHIND'` ONLY — its own design explicitly excludes `CONFLICTING`/`DIRTY` ("a
 * real-conflict case… stays left to `/finish`"). Nothing anywhere watches THIS axis. See `#xw0odtv`'s own card
 * for the full reconstruction (merge-base, the overlapping #1911 commit, the backlog search ruling out a
 * duplicate).
 *
 * ALERT-ONLY WAS THE ORIGINAL DESIGN; `#xu2krte` (ratified 2026-09-06,
 * `docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#parked-pr-conflict-dispatched-not-scripted`) NARROWED THAT, NOT REVERSED IT.
 * A real content conflict has no single mechanically-correct resolution for a deterministic SCRIPT: resolving it
 * means choosing which side's edit wins in the overlapping region, exactly the judgment #2824's own design
 * already refuses to automate for this same CONFLICTING/DIRTY case. That reasoning does not extend to
 * dispatching a real AGENT at the same conflict, though — the agent's output still lands through the identical
 * independent-review gate this file's own alert protects (`review:human`/`review:pending`/`review:changes` is
 * never touched by a fix agent, conflict or otherwise). So on a FRESH conflict this pass now does TWO things,
 * not one: it still applies the informative label + one-time alert (below, unchanged), AND it hands the PR to
 * the SAME bounce+fix-dispatch pipeline `we:scripts/conveyor/reconcile-fix-dispatch.mjs` already runs for an
 * ordinary reviewer finding — via `we:scripts/conveyor/reconcile-finding.mjs` ({@link postConflictFinding}) —
 * UNLESS the conflict sits in a declarative-leash/statute-tier file ({@link isStatuteTierConflict}), in which
 * case it routes straight to a human via `we:scripts/conveyor/stand-down.mjs --reason=conflict`
 * ({@link postConflictStandDown}) with no dispatch attempt at all. This file itself still never resolves a
 * conflict or writes a fix — it only decides which of the two existing downstream pipelines a fresh conflict
 * reaches.
 *
 * RESOLVED CONFLICTS OWE A FRESH REVIEW. Once GitHub confirms `mergeable: MERGEABLE` on a previously
 * flagged PR still carrying `review:changes`, hand it to `we:scripts/conveyor/rearm-review.mjs` — the SAME
 * sanctioned hand-back an ordinary repaired bounce uses. Removing only the conflict label stranded this
 * pass's bounce forever; resurrecting an old `review:accepted` would certify a diff predating the resolution.
 * The watcher still posts no clearance comment of its own: rearm owns the durable comment and the
 * `review:changes → review:pending` swap, preserving `review:human`. UNKNOWN is not proof of resolution.
 *
 * PURE-CORE / IO-SHELL SPLIT (mirrors `we:scripts/conveyor/branch-drift.mjs` and
 * `we:scripts/conveyor/review-status-tag.mjs`):
 *   • {@link isParkedConflictTarget} and {@link planConflictLabelChange} are PURE — no fs/git/gh/clock.
 *   • The IO shell ({@link defaultListParkedPrs}, {@link watchParkedPrConflicts}, the CLI) owns every `gh` call,
 *     via `we:scripts/lib/review-label-provider.mjs`'s already-tested, injectable provider port — no new
 *     `execFileSync('gh', …)` call site is hand-rolled here.
 *
 * IDEMPOTENCY, NO SEPARATE STORE. The `merge-status:conflicting` label's own presence/absence on the PR IS the
 * durable marker (mirrors `we:scripts/conveyor/review-status-tag.mjs`'s own "the label is the state" contract):
 * a comment is posted only on the transition from absent→present, never repeated while the label already sits
 * on the PR, and the label is removed (self-healing, no comment) the tick the conflict clears — no git note, no
 * `.claude/locks` entry, no new JSON store (per the #2612 "no parallel state store" ruling).
 *
 * APPROVED PRS TOO (x832e2v, live 2026-09-23). An approved/queued PR (`review:accepted` / `ready-to-merge`)
 * that drifts into a conflict used to be skipped by this pass AND silently skipped by the drain. It is now
 * labelled at once but bounced only after {@link QUEUED_CONFLICT_GRACE_MS}, giving the drain first try at
 * the one conflict it heals itself; the bounce strips the old approval, so the resolved diff is re-reviewed.
 *
 * THE CADENCE. Each constellation repo runs this as its own resident `pass-daemon` watcher
 * (`we:skills-src/conveyor/daemon-manifest.mjs`, `parked-pr-conflict-watch-<repo>`); the headless runner's
 * `makeCliMechanicalPasses` also calls it when that runner is up.
