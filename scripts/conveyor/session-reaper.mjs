 * @description THE CONVEYOR SESSION REAPER (WE #3435, epic #3383). Walks `claude agents --json` and calls
 *   `claude stop <id>` on every BACKGROUND session that is done producing more work — nothing did this before:
 *   `lease-reaper.mjs` (#2667) reclaims LANE leases, a wholly separate resource from a `claude agents` session
 *   registration. Left undone, every review/fix/build dispatch this epic's own mechanism runs adds one more
 *   entry that stays listed until a human runs `claude stop <id>` by hand — 12 finished `review-*` sessions
 *   plus 4 stale `conveyor-*` ones in one live-fire night alone.
 *
 * MIRRORS `lease-reaper.mjs`'S PURE-CORE / IO-SHELL SPLIT:
 *   • The PURE core ({@link classifySessionReap}, {@link classifySessionReapWithGroundTruth},
 *     {@link sessionReapPlan}, {@link sessionTarget}) has NO fs / exec / clock — every session row (and, for
 *     the ground-truth upgrade, every resolver answer) is passed in exactly as shaped by its caller. Unit-tested
 *     directly on fixtures.
 *   • The IO SHELL (the `main()` CLI) owns the one `claude agents --json` read, the ground-truth resolver's
 *     backlog-file reads and `gh pr view` calls, and the stop delegation to `dispatch-abort.mjs`'s
 *     `stopSession` — the ONE existing `claude stop <id>` wrapper in this repo (built for #3383's own "don't
 *     `kill`, `claude stop`" lesson) — rather than re-shelling `claude` a second way.
 *
 * WHY `done`/`failed` STATE ALONE WAS NOT ENOUGH (found live 2026-09-03, `conveyor-3451`). The original cut of
 * this reaper (above) reasoned that a state-only reap axis was safe by construction because no `done`/`failed`
 * FALSE POSITIVE had ever been observed (a session `claude` itself reports finished that was still actually
 * running) — that reasoning still holds and is UNCHANGED below. What it did not address, because nothing had
 * yet evidenced it, is the opposite failure: a session whose real-world work is genuinely finished — its own
 * backlog item `status: resolved`, a real PR merged — while `claude agents` itself never advances that
 * session's `state` past `working`/`blocked` at all. Confirmed live: `conveyor-3451`'s target,
 * `we:backlog/3451-*.md`, carries `status: resolved` with a merged PR (`chalbert/web-everything#1862`, "WE
 * #3451: resolve — active → resolved"), yet the SAME live `claude agents --json --all` listing that landed
 * that PR still reported `conveyor-3451` as `state: "blocked"` — a session the original state-only axis would
 * never touch. A same-night survey of the other 22 non-`done`/`failed` background rows found 17 in the
 * identical shape (target confirmed `status: resolved`, session state stuck at `working`) against 6 genuinely
 * still-open ones (`conveyor-2786`, `conveyor-3447c`, `prepare-3436`, `prepare-3438`, `prepare-3441`, and
 * `review-1871` — an OPEN, unmerged PR) — real, sizable, not a one-off.
 *
 * THE FIX IS AN ADDITIONAL AXIS, NOT A REPLACEMENT. {@link classifySessionReapWithGroundTruth} upgrades a
 * `not-terminal` verdict to `reap:true` ONLY when an injected ground-truth resolver independently confirms the
 * session's OWN target item/PR (derived from its `name` by {@link sessionTarget}, the same
 * `conveyor-<NUM>`/`prepare-<NUM>`/`prepare-decision-<NUM>`/`review-<PR>`/`fix-<PR>`/`ci-heal-<PR>` grammar
 * `we:scripts/conveyor/lease-reaper.mjs`'s `itemNumFromSession` and `we:scripts/operations/dispatch-lane.mjs`'s
 * `sessionSlugFor` already mint) is done — never on a guess, never widening the original `done`/`failed` axis
 * itself. A session whose name matches no known grammar, or whose target cannot be confirmed one way or the
 * other (an unreadable backlog file, a `gh` failure/timeout), is left exactly as before: `not-terminal`, kept.
 * This mirrors the ground-truth-check pattern `we:backlog/3457-*.md` ratified for the DISPATCH side (never
 * guess, always verify against real backlog/GitHub state before acting) — reused here for REAP, its inverse.
 *
 * COST DISCIPLINE, mirroring `we:scripts/operations/dispatch-lane-io.mjs`'s own `PR_LIST_TIMEOUT_MS`/
 * `PR_LIST_LIMIT` bounds. A backlog-item ground-truth check is one local file read — no rate-limit concern, so
 * it is unbounded. A PR-target check is one real `gh pr view <pr>` network call, bounded two ways: (1) it
 * reuses `dispatch-lane-io.mjs`'s own `prListTimeoutMs` per-call timeout rather than inventing a second knob
 * for the same class of cost (`defaultLaneRefForPr`'s own docblock names this exact reuse), and (2)
 * {@link makeGroundTruthResolver} caps the number of `gh pr view` calls ONE reaper pass will make
 * ({@link MAX_GH_PR_VIEW_CALLS_PER_TICK}) — a candidate past the cap is left `not-terminal` this tick and
 * re-tried the next one, never an unbounded `gh` burst. Every resolver answer is cached per pass too, so two
 * sessions naming the same target (a retried `conveyor-3441b` alongside `conveyor-3441`) cost one lookup.
 *
 * THE THREE TERMINAL STATES, measured live against a real `claude agents --json --all` listing (192 rows,
 * 2026-09-03) rather than assumed: `done` (134), `stopped` (31), `failed` (1) — `working` (21) is the only
 * non-terminal state this environment's own dispatches produced that day; `blocked` is the fixture's own
 * shape (`__fixtures__/claude-agents-payload.json`), also confirmed live the same night on `conveyor-3451`
 * itself. `stopped` needs NO action (the session is already stopped — re-stopping it is a wasted subprocess
 * call, not a correctness issue, since {@link stopSession} treats an already-gone handle as benign; still
 * worth naming so `keep`'s reason distinguishes it from a live one). `done` and `failed` are the two
 * ({@link TERMINAL_REAP_STATES}) the base axis acts on; `working`/`blocked`/undefined are the ones the new
 * ground-truth axis can now ALSO act on, but only when independently confirmed.
 *
 * `kind !== 'background'` IS AN ABSOLUTE GUARD, CHECKED BEFORE STATE OR GROUND TRUTH. The SAME listing that
 * carries every dispatched agent also carries the operator's own INTERACTIVE terminal sessions (`kind:
 * 'interactive'`, `pid` set, no `state` field at all — measured live, 5 of 192 rows). An interactive row never
 * has a `state` of `done`/`failed` today, and its `name` is never one of this reaper's dispatcher-minted
 * grammars either, but the guard is structural, checked first, and never depends on either of those staying
 * true — the blast radius of `claude stop`-ing a human's own open terminal session is categorically worse than
 * leaving a finished background dispatch listed one tick longer.
 *
 * `claude stop`'S REPORTED SUCCESS IS A HINT, NOT A CERTAINTY (found live 2026-09-02, confirmed against
 * upstream `anthropics/claude-code` issues #65925/#45250/#41461): a stop can report success while the local
 * listing keeps reporting the session unchanged. This reaper does not re-poll to confirm — that would add a
 * second `claude agents --json` read (and a race) for a confirmation this repo already knows is unreliable —
 * it logs {@link stopSession}'s own `alreadyGone` distinction and moves on, exactly as best-effort as
 * `lease-reaper.mjs`'s own per-candidate try/catch.
 *
 * WHY `id`, NOT `sessionId` — the near-universal `claude stop` FAILURE `we:backlog/3435-*.md`'s "Found live"
 * finding 3 recorded (all five sessions, including `conveyor-3421b`, came back "No job matching" on `claude
 * stop <sessionId>`) was read at the time as a CLI/registry-staleness limitation, the same family as the
 * success-side note just above. It is not that. It is a wrong-FIELD bug: this loop passed `session.sessionId`
 * (the full listing-internal UUID `claude stop`/`claude rm` do not match on) where it should have passed
 * `session.id` (the short form the CLI actually accepts). Verified live 2026-09-03: a fresh `claude agents
 * --json --all` (208 rows) shows `id` present on all 204 `kind: 'background'` rows and absent on exactly the 4
 * `kind: 'interactive'` ones (a human's own terminal/Remote-Control session — never a row this reaper's `kind
 * !== 'background'` guard, above, would let reach the stop call in the first place). So within this reaper's
 * own domain `id` is always present — never the "absent from half the listing" shape `dispatch-lane-io.mjs
 * #listedSessionIds`'s own docblock measured (correctly, for the FULL mixed listing that function reads; that
 * finding stands, it just does not extend to `kind: 'background'` rows, the only ones this file ever acts on).
 * Direct proof the swap fixes the failure, same session: `claude stop <full sessionId>` on a real `done`
 * session (`conveyor-2972`) exited 1 with "No job matching"; `claude stop <short id>` on the SAME session
 * immediately after exited 0, "stopped". THIS DOES NOT MAKE `claude stop` UNIVERSALLY RELIABLE — a genuinely-
 * already-exited background session can still legitimately answer "No job matching" even given the correct
 * `id` (that is {@link stopSession}'s own documented `alreadyGone` case, expected and benign); today's failure
 * was near-100% and traced to the wrong field, not to occasional legitimate staleness. `main()`'s stop loop
 * below therefore reads `session.id` (never `session.sessionId`) for the actual handle, and treats a missing
 * `id` on a reap candidate as a logged anomaly rather than a silent skip — it should never happen given the
 * `kind !== 'background'` guard above, but "should never happen" is not the same as "cannot happen".

/**
 * {@link classifySessionReap}'s verdict, UPGRADED to `reap:true` when the base verdict is `not-terminal` AND
 * one of THREE independent axes confirms the session is actually done, tried in this order:
 *
 *   1. **The session's own self-reported completion record** ({@link ../operations/completion-store.mjs},
 *      #3436) — the most direct signal there is, since `review-*`/`fix-*` agent briefs write `status: 'done'`
 *      to it at their own exit, keyed by their own exact session name. Injected as `completionFor(name)`;
 *      never called for a name `completionPath` would refuse (an interactive session's free-text name, say) —
 *      the caller (`makeCompletionResolver`, below) already wraps that in a try/catch, so this axis simply
 *      never fires rather than throwing.
 *   2. **The pre-existing backlog-item / PR-merged ground truth** ({@link groundTruthForItem} /
 *      {@link groundTruthForPr}, unchanged from before #3383) — same as before this file's daemon-split work.
 *   3. **A generous idle timeout**, LAST RESORT ONLY: a `blocked` session (never `working` — see
 *      `neverReapWorking` below — and never a bare `undefined` state, which is too ambiguous a shape to time
 *      out on) that axes 1–2 could not confirm EITHER WAY (no completion record, no derivable target, or a
 *      resolver answer of `null`/unknown) is reaped once it has sat past `idleThresholdMs` since its own
 *      `startedAt`. Deliberately gated OFF a `resolved: false` answer — if axis 2 explicitly said "still
 *      genuinely open" (`we:backlog/2786-*.md`'s own shape), age never overrides that. `idleThresholdMs`
 *      defaults to `0` (disabled) — this is an approximation (session START time, not last-activity time; no
 *      such field exists in a `claude agents --json` row), so a caller opts in deliberately rather than this
 *      function silently starting to time sessions out.
 *
 * `neverReapWorking` (default `false`, preserving every existing caller's behavior byte for byte) is a
 * caller-scoped STRICTER MODE: when `true`, a `state: 'working'` row is never upgraded by ANY of the three
 * axes above, full stop — even a completion record or a merged PR leaves it `not-terminal`/kept. This exists
 * because a daemon calling this reaper against LIVE production sessions for the first time (epic #3383) wants
 * a stronger guarantee than the original 2026-09-03 ground-truth axis shipped with: "the listing says this
 * session is still actively doing something" is treated as authoritative over any secondary signal, never
 * second-guessed. The ORIGINAL axis (this flag `false`, still the function's own default) is unchanged and
 * still exercised by every pre-existing test in this file — see `session-reaper.test.mjs`'s own
 * `review-1862`-while-`working` case, which predates this flag and still passes exactly as before.
 *
 * Never downgrades a verdict, never touches `not-background`/`wrong-cwd`/`already-stopped`/already-terminal
 * rows. Omitting every new option (or passing a non-function `groundTruthFor`) makes this byte-identical to
 * the pre-#3383 function — every addition here is strictly additive.
 *
 * AXIS 0 — HUNG-TRANSCRIPT DETECTION (epic #3383 continuation), checked FIRST, BEFORE even the
 * `neverReapWorking`/`state:'working'` guard below, and it is the ONLY axis in this function allowed to run
 * ahead of that guard. Every axis below it treats `neverReapWorking` as authoritative because the signal it
 * is weighing (a completion record, ground truth, an idle timer) says nothing about whether the LISTING's own
 * `state: 'working'` is honest — so a daemon that wants "trust the listing over everything else" gets exactly
 * that. Hung-detection exists for the OPPOSITE reason: its entire premise is that `state: 'working'` CAN BE
 * WRONG — a session can crash or hang without ever telling the CLI to update its own state — and the way it
 * proves that is by reading the session's OWN transcript file directly (see
 * `we:scripts/conveyor/hung-session.mjs`), independent of anything the listing or the agent chooses to report.
 * Letting `neverReapWorking` veto THIS axis would mean the one daemon mode built to distrust a stale listing
 * is precisely the mode where a session the listing is WRONG about can never be reaped — the exact live
 * failure (chalbert/web-everything `review-2582`, state `working`, dead) this axis exists to close. Injected
 * as `hungFor(session)`, mirroring `completionFor`/`groundTruthFor`'s own try/catch-to-null discipline in the
 * caller — never called for a session missing `cwd`/`sessionId`, and any read failure answers "not hung",
 * never a guess.
