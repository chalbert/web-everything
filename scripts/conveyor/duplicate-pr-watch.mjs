 * @file scripts/conveyor/duplicate-pr-watch.mjs
 * @description THE DUPLICATE-PR WATCH (`#xs19sz9`) — a standing, mechanical pass that catches TWO OR MORE
 *   open PRs delivering the SAME backlog item number and raises a visible, non-blocking finding on each one,
 *   without ever picking which one to keep.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Live incident, 2026-09-05: the in-flight BUILD guard (`bookkeeping.buildGuards`) was
 * session-ephemeral — wiped by a restart or lost across ticks — so a build whose delivery agent was genuinely
 * still alive read, from ground truth alone, exactly like a never-dispatched item, and the tick loop launched a
 * SECOND independent delivery agent at it. That produced a QUADRUPLE-PR storm on item #3478 (PRs #1933/#1935/
 * #1937/#1939) and double-PR pairs on #3230 (#1928/#1931), #2819 (#1936/#1940), and #3481 (#1929/#1930) — eight
 * PRs total, all real, all mergeable, all silently sitting in the open-PR list with nothing anywhere noticing
 * they duplicated each other. The root cause (the lost in-flight guard) is fixed separately (PR #1946, "a
 * durable floor for the in-flight build guard"), but that fix prevents FUTURE re-dispatches — it does nothing
 * to notice a duplicate pair that slips through some other way (a manual re-dispatch, a retried build whose
 * predecessor's PR never got closed, two independent sessions racing the same item). Nothing anywhere watches
 * THIS axis: `we:scripts/conveyor/parked-pr-conflict-watch.mjs` (#xw0odtv) watches for a PR drifting into a
 * merge conflict against `main`, not for a sibling PR building the same item; `we:scripts/conveyor/
 * branch-drift.mjs` (#3464) watches one named long-lived branch; `we:scripts/conveyor/reconcile-fix-dispatch.mjs`
 * (#3438) dispatches a fix for an ALREADY-bounced PR, it never decides a PR needs bouncing in the first place.
 *
 * WHY A MANUALLY-INVESTIGATED CLOSE PROVED THIS MUST STAY DETECT-ONLY. Resolving the four live incident groups
 * by hand (reading real diffs, not file/line counts) found three clean-superset cases — safe to close the
 * losers — and ONE case (#2819, PRs #1936/#1940) that was NOT a superset at all: both PRs touch the same
 * functions with genuinely different, non-overlapping detection logic, and the correct outcome is a human/agent
 * MERGING the good parts of both, not picking a winner. A script cannot tell those two cases apart without
 * reading the actual diff content — exactly the judgment `we:docs/agent/platform-decisions.md` (the "alert,
 * don't auto-resolve content decisions" line `#xw0odtv` itself established for merge conflicts) refuses to
 * automate. So this pass's job is the one mechanically-safe half: notice the duplicate, say so, on EVERY PR in
 * the group — never close one, never guess which is better.
 *
 * HOW "delivers the same item" IS DECIDED — REUSED, NOT REINVENTED. `we:scripts/lib/open-pr-items.mjs#deliveredItemNumsFromPr`
 * already answers "which backlog item id(s) does this PR's ref/title claim to DELIVER" for the readiness
 * ranker's own exclusion list, with eight rounds of hard-won false-positive guards (annotation PRs, batch-chain
 * trailing segments, date-shaped refs, "does not resolve #NNN" disclaimers, all-markdown diffs, "no code
 * changes" blanket disclaimers — see that file's own docstring). Re-deriving any of that here would silently
 * diverge from the readiness ranker's own notion of "delivers" the first time either file changes. This pass
 * imports the function directly and groups by its output.
 *
 * GENUINE SLICE vs. DUPLICATE — ALREADY DISAMBIGUATED BY THE ID ITSELF, NO EXTRA CARVE-OUT NEEDED.
 * `we:docs/agent/backlog-workflow.md`'s own sizing convention ("Splitting a large story") gives every
 * legitimately-different slice of an epic its OWN item number (`parent: "NNN"` links the slice back to the
 * epic it rolls under) — two PRs building two different slices of the same epic therefore deliver two
 * DIFFERENT item numbers and never land in the same group here. The one other shape considered — a single item
 * intentionally delivered across MULTIPLE PRs over time (`we:backlog/3443-*.md`'s own "covers the whole ongoing
 * effort, not one PR" framing) — is, by that same card's own Done-when text, a SEQUENTIAL relay (each increment
 * "is its own small PR... landed... never a bulk merge"), not two PRs concurrently open at once. So under this
 * repo's own conventions there is no legitimate reason for 2+ OPEN PRs to ever deliver the identical item
 * number at the same time — any occurrence this pass finds is, by construction, exactly the class it exists to
 * catch. Over-firing on a hypothetical legitimate exception costs one reviewer's attention (the same asymmetry
 * `we:scripts/lib/review-escalation.mjs` names throughout); under-firing lets a real duplicate storm sit
 * invisible, which is the incident this pass was born from.
 *
 * HOW THE FINDING IS RAISED — REUSED, NOT A THIRD MECHANISM. `we:scripts/conveyor/reconcile-finding.mjs`
 * (landed the same night as this pass) is already the shim for "a mechanical/reconciliation pass found this PR
 * conflicts with a decision made elsewhere in the repo" — precisely this pass's shape (the "decision made
 * elsewhere" being "another open PR already claims this item"). Posting through it means the finding rides the
 * SAME `review:changes` bounce every other reconciliation finding does, routes into the same fix→re-review
 * cycle (`we:scripts/conveyor/reconcile-fix-dispatch.mjs`), and can never itself clear a hold or land anything
 * (`review:changes` never emits `review:accepted`) — no new label, no new comment scheme, no new drain rule.
 * This file shells `node we:scripts/conveyor/reconcile-finding.mjs <pr> --body-file=<tmp file>` per finding
 * (never imports `runReconcileFindingCli` in-process — that function's shared harness calls `process.exit()` on
 * completion, which would kill this pass after its FIRST finding in a multi-PR sweep), mirroring the
 * subprocess-per-pass composition `we:skills-src/conveyor/runner.mjs#makeCliMechanicalPasses` already uses for
 * every sibling pass.
 *
 * DEDUP — THE FINDING'S OWN EFFECT IS THE DURABLE MARKER, NO SEPARATE STORE (mirrors `#xw0odtv`'s own
 * "the label's presence IS the state" contract, #2612 "no parallel state store" ruling). Reusing an EXISTING
 * label as that marker, rather than minting a new one, is required here — `reconcile-finding.mjs` posts through
 * the ratified `review:changes` label, and inventing a second `dup-pr:flagged`-shaped label beside it would be
 * exactly the "new label or new comment scheme" `reconcile-finding.mjs`'s own docstring already argued against.
 * So: a PR that ALREADY carries `review:changes` is skipped — whether this pass's own prior sweep put it there
 * or a genuine human/agent review did, the PR is already parked and will not silently merge, so re-posting the
 * same finding every tick would only spam a comment with no new information. UNLIKE `#xw0odtv`'s conflict
 * label, this is NOT self-clearing: `reconcile-finding.mjs`'s own docstring is explicit that a sequencing
 * finding "has no single mechanically-correct resolution" and clearing it is a human/agent judgment call, never
 * this file's to make — so once flagged, a PR stays flagged until a human/agent explicitly clears
 * `review:changes` (accepts it, or fixes and re-arms), exactly like every other reconciliation finding.
 *
 * PURE-CORE / IO-SHELL SPLIT (mirrors `we:scripts/conveyor/parked-pr-conflict-watch.mjs`):
 *   • {@link groupPrsByDeliveredItem}, {@link planDuplicateFindings}, and {@link buildDuplicateFindingBody} are
 *     PURE — no fs/git/gh/clock/process.
 *   • The IO shell ({@link defaultListOpenPrs}, {@link defaultPostFinding}, {@link watchDuplicatePrs}, the CLI)
 *     owns every `gh`/subprocess call.
 *
 * THE CADENCE. Wired into `we:skills-src/conveyor/runner.mjs#makeCliMechanicalPasses`, beside the
 * `we:scripts/conveyor/parked-pr-conflict-watch.mjs` line — the same "piggyback on a pass the headless runner
 * already ticks" shape both `#3464` and `#xw0odtv` used, so a duplicate-PR pair is checked every tick with no
 * new cron/daemon.
