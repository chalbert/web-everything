/**
 * review-set-label.mjs — swap a PR's review label, INVARIANT-2 guarded (#2470, increment 2 of 2). Also the
 * SINGLE HOME of the shared review-label CLI harness (#2644): a PURE `decideSetLabel` decides the swap for a
 * reviewer verdict (`accepted` / `changes`) OR the fix-agent re-arm (`rearm`), and a thin `runReviewLabelCli`
 * does the `gh` observe→write→re-read arc (the two writes are the comment and the label swap; which one goes
 * first is decided per-PR by the #2964 ordering rule — see `runReviewLabelCli`). The conveyor's
 * `rearm-review.mjs` is now a THIN shim over
 * both (it used to clone this file byte-for-byte). Single-sourced in WE (Native-First / zero standard-impl here
 * — this is a definition + write tool, not product code) so the plateau console and the conveyor fix agent both
 * shell/import it rather than re-implementing how a label swap lands.
 *
 * #2844 — INVARIANT 2 says a `review:human` PR may not be machine-cleared; it says NOTHING about who clears a
 * `review:pending` one, and before #2844 nothing else did either. This CLI now REFUSES an `--to=accepted` verdict
 * whose clearing actor is provably the PR's own author (`we:scripts/lib/review-independence.mjs`), stamps the
 * clearing actor's id into the durable comment, and — when independence could not be established — says so in that
 * comment rather than leaving a silence a reader would misread as independence.
 *
 * `--to=clear-human` IS EXEMPT FROM THAT REFUSAL (PR #1100 review). The actor id is `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` and a
 * SUBAGENT INHERITS ITS PARENT'S, so the comparison is SESSION-level and the operator's own `/review` ceremony —
 * which shells this CLI from inside the session that opened the PR — is a self-clear by that measure. Refusing the
 * human ceremony too made NOTHING clearable through the sanctioned path. The exemption is not a weakening: the
 * ceremony is refused unless the PR carries `review:human` and requires an explicit `--actor` plus a quoted
 * `--reason`, and the durable comment records that a HUMAN CEREMONY cleared it, never that an
 * established-independent agent did. THERE IS NO `--force` AND NO FLAG that lifts the `--to=accepted` refusal:
 * the two routes that clear a self-authored PR are the `clear-human` ceremony (on a `review:human` PR) and running
 * the review from a session that did not open the PR. The refusal message names exactly those two.
 *
 * INVARIANT 2 (the whole point): a `review:human` PR is NEVER cleared to `review:accepted` by anything but a
 * human's /review ceremony. `decideSetLabel` REFUSES `to==='accepted'` when the PR carries `review:human`
 * (`gate-self` is human-ceremony-only). The refusal lives in the PURE core so it is unbypassable — the CLI
 * cannot route around it. Do NOT weaken it. The `rearm` target carries the sibling #2630 invariant: an auto-fix
 * re-arms `review:changes → review:pending` but NEVER emits `review:accepted` and NEVER removes `review:human`.
 *
 * #2895 — INVARIANT 2 says who may NOT clear a gate-self PR; the `clear-human` target says how the one who MAY
 * actually does it. Before this, #2882 closed the raw label edit without opening a replacement, so the single
 * act the `review:human` tier exists to enable had no sanctioned way to perform it and the operator was pushed
 * to an unrecorded `gh` call — losing the `reviewed-sha` stamp and the attributed comment. `clear-human` is the
 * ONLY target that removes `review:human`, and `accepted` stays unconditionally refused on a `review:human` PR
 * — see `decideSetLabel` for why this is a target rather than a flag.
 *
 * WHAT THIS TARGET DOES NOT DO, stated up front so nobody re-derives it: it does NOT verify that a human ran
 * it. #2895 RULED that the unforgeable actor signal is DEFERRED — no local construct survives an agent with
 * shell access on the same machine (a flag is trivially passed; a local console's token is scrapeable; a tty
 * check is satisfied by `script`/`expect`). So this ships as the raw command with better manners, and the
 * manners are the point: the `reviewed-sha` stamp, an attributed comment, a stated reason, one documented path
 * instead of an ad-hoc paste. The mitigation that replaces the missing signal is the HONESTY TAX — `--actor`
 * and `--reason` are both REQUIRED, so misuse takes a lie rather than a silence, and every surface that reports
 * a clearance says what the record proves (the sanctioned path was followed) and not what it does not (that a
 * human followed it). The durable fix is #2946 (a hardware human-presence gesture), filed `someday`.
 *
 * Split mirrors `we:scripts/review-detail.mjs`: a PURE decider that takes the already-observed labels and
 * returns the swap, plus a thin impure CLI that does the `gh` calls and prints. REUSES
 * `we:scripts/lib/review-escalation.mjs` (`REVIEW_LABELS`, `hasReviewLabel`) — it never re-hardcodes the
 * label strings.

 * against `gh`; only three things differ and they arrive as config (exactly the deltas #2644 names):
 *   • `defaultActor` — who the durable comment is attributed to;
 *   • `buildComment({ to, actor, decision }) => string` — the comment body;
 *   • `repoOptional` — when true a missing `--repo` is derived from the cwd repo (`gh repo view`; the fix agent
 *     runs inside its own lane clone, so cwd IS the PR's repo); when false `--repo` is required.
 * `fixedTo` pins the verdict (rearm) or, when null, the harness parses + validates `--to` (accepted/changes).
 * The printed payload shapes stay the caller's, via `successResult`/`refusalResult`. Impure (shells gh); the
 * PURE `decideSetLabel` above owns every invariant, so this harness only moves bytes.
 *
 * Fails closed on INPUT — every input is validated BEFORE any gh mutation. It does NOT promise atomicity, and
 * saying it did was false (#2964): the swap and the durable comment are two non-atomic `gh` calls, so a gh error
 * between them exits non-zero with ONE of the two already landed. What #2964 bought is that the half left behind
 * is the SAFE one to lose — comment first on a PR that is not yet accepted (an orphan marker is never read), swap
 * first on one that already is (an orphan marker there would freshen the #2409 gate's coverage for an acceptance
 * that never landed). See the ordering block in the body for the full argument; the seam is not sealed, only
 * pointed the safe way.
 *
 * `allowClearHuman` is the opt-in for the #2895 gate-self clearance. SAY WHAT IT ACTUALLY IS (PR #1056 review,
 * round 4 — the earlier wording over-claimed): it binds IMPORTERS ONLY, and today it binds nobody. This file's
 * own `IS_CLI` block passes `true` unconditionally, so EVERY shell caller of this CLI is opted in and the flag
 * constrains nothing on a command line. The one importer of this harness, `we:scripts/conveyor/rearm-review.mjs`,
 * pins `fixedTo: 'rearm'` and so could never reach `clear-human` by relaying an argv anyway; and nothing else
 * reaches the target at all — `we:scripts/lib/auto-land-seam.mjs#buildSetLabelArgs` builds a literal
 * `--to=accepted`. What the boolean buys is narrow and forward-looking: a FUTURE importer that forwards argv it
 * did not vet (the #2945 console is the next candidate) cannot land on `clear-human` unless it names the
 * capability in its own source, where a reviewer reads it. It is NOT a trust boundary and NOT a barrier — it is
 * an ordinary parameter of an exported function, so an importer that wants it just passes it. That is accepted,
 * because #2895 ruled the unforgeable signal deferred (file header); the mitigation is the honesty tax below,
 * not this boolean. It is deliberately a DUMB BOOLEAN rather than an injected predicate — a caller may declare a
 * capability, never supply a verdict (PR #1056 review, B2).

  // where that is both possible and safe: EVERY refusal is already behind us — the argv validation, the
  // #2953 OPEN-state gate, the #2844 self-clear refusal, the pure `decideSetLabel` decision and the size
  // guard have all run and none of them can fire again. The only thing that can still fail below is `gh`
  // TRANSPORT, and a transport failure does not un-form the verdict: the reviewer decided, and the row says
  // so. What it costs is an orphan row with no label, which `we:scripts/review-ledger-check.mjs` reports as
  // `unlabeled` — a visible Phase-1 observation, which is exactly what this phase is for.
  //
  // THIS IS NOT IN CONFLICT WITH #3035's OPPOSITE ORDER, and the difference matters. The declared `review-pr`
  // operation (`we:scripts/operations/review-pr.mjs`) puts its ledger effect at ordinal 2, AFTER the label
  // effect, on the stated grounds that "an orphan row in the merge authority is NOT inert, so it must never
  // precede the label it vouches for". That is right THERE, because from outside this process the operation
  // cannot see the five refusals above — its effect 1 shells this CLI, which may still refuse. It is right
  // HERE too, one layer down, because at this line those refusals have already happened. The two orderings
  // are the same rule ("never write the row while a refusal is still reachable") applied at two seams; the
  // operation's own sink is therefore a RECONCILER, not a second writer (see review-pr-io.mjs).
  //
  // FAIL-SOFT ON THE LEDGER, DELIBERATELY: a ledger write failure does NOT abort the verdict. In Phase 1 the
  // ledger is shadow — nothing merges on it — so refusing an operator's verdict because a shadow file could
  // not be written would trade a real capability for an imaginary one. The miss goes to stderr (so it is
  // visible in a run log) and the checker reports the PR as `unledgered`. This posture MUST be revisited at
  // Phase 2, where a missing row means an un-mergeable PR rather than a missing observation.
  //
  // THE `to` → VERDICT MAPPING IS NOT WRITTEN HERE. It lives in `verdictForLabelTarget`
  // (`we:scripts/lib/verdict-ledger.mjs`) because the declared operation's reconciling sink has to derive the
  // SAME verdict from the SAME `to` to decide whether the row it finds is this round's row. A private copy of

  //     `review:accepted` check (lazily, inside `if (hasReviewLabel(...accepted))` in `we:scripts/merge-ai-prs.mjs`,
  //     and again inside `decideReviewGate`'s accepted branch), so a marker with no label behind it is never read
  //     and the command stays re-runnable. An orphan LABEL is not inert: `review:accepted` with no marker makes
  //     `acceptanceCoversHead` fail OPEN, and the drain then merges with the #2409 staleness gate disarmed. Under
  //     the old edit-first order that was the reachable state — the exact hole this item was filed for.
  //
  //   • ALREADY accepted (the re-accept-after-a-fix flow: accepted at an older head, a commit rode in, the reviewer
  //     re-verdicts) — SWAP FIRST, the pre-#2964 order, deliberately kept HERE and only here. The swap degenerates
  //     to an idempotent `--add-label review:accepted`, so comment-first would post a marker naming the LIVE head
  //     while the acceptance is already live: `parseReviewedSha` takes the LATEST marker, `acceptanceCoversHead`
  //     flips to `covers: true`, and a run whose `gh pr edit` then FAILED would have FRESHENED the coverage of an
  //     acceptance it never applied — the drain lands a tree no successful swap vouched for. Swap-first keeps the
  //     marker on the swap side of that seam: a failed edit exits before the comment, the durable marker still
  //     names the OLD head, and the gate correctly re-parks. (Losing the comment after a successful swap here
  //     costs a RECORD, not the gate: the marker stays stale, which is the strict direction.)
  //
  // This is shape 1 from the item ("keep the marker on the swap side of the seam"), narrowed to the one case where
  // the marker is not inert. Shape 1 applied UNCONDITIONALLY — record first without the marker, swap, then stamp
  // the marker in a second comment — was rejected because it leaves the headline hole open: a failed marker post
  // after a successful swap is still `review:accepted` + no marker + fail-open. Shape 2 (refuse the run outright
  // when the PR is already accepted) was rejected because it removes the re-accept path the #2409 gate depends on
  // to un-stick a re-parked PR, and the item says that needs its own replacement.
  //
  // The test is keyed on the LABEL, not on `to`, on purpose: `buildComment` is caller-supplied, so this harness

/**
 * we:scripts/review-set-label.mjs#buildVerdictComment — the reviewer-verdict comment body. PURE, so the one
 * place the `reviewed-sha` marker is attached to an accept is unit-testable.
 *
 * #2882 — `body` is the OPTIONAL caller-supplied write-up. The loop console records a one-line verdict and
 * passes nothing; `/review` (`we:skills-src/review/SKILL.md`) passes its full findings + verdict via
 * `--body-file`. Before this, the CLI could only emit the fixed one-liner, so `/review` hand-rolled
 * `gh pr edit` + `gh pr comment` to get a detailed comment — and thereby lost the marker AND bypassed
 * INVARIANT 2, which lives in `decideSetLabel` and only binds callers that come through here. Accepting a body
 * removes the reason to route around the single home.
 *
 * #2409 — on `accepted` the reviewed head SHA is stamped (`buildReviewedShaMarker`) so the drain can later
 * refuse to honour the acceptance if the head advanced past the reviewed tree.
 *
 * THE STAMP MUST WIN, AND THE READER DECIDES WHAT WINNING MEANS. `parseReviewedSha` is LAST-match-wins (it
 * scans every marker in a body and keeps the final one), so this builder does two things, belt and braces:
 *   1. it STRIPS any `reviewed-sha` marker out of the caller's body — a `/review` write-up legitimately quotes
 *      a prior round's marker while explaining why the head moved (#983's re-accept comment did exactly that),
 *      and a quoted marker must never be mistaken for this verdict's claim; and
 *   2. it appends its own marker LAST, so even a marker this strip failed to recognise cannot outrank it.
 * The first cut of #2882 put the marker FIRST and reasoned backwards about the reader — which silently
 * REGRESSED the pre-#2882 behaviour, because a quoted marker then overwrote the stamp. Caught in review on
 * PR #1005. The pin for this is a ROUND-TRIP assertion through the real `parseReviewedSha`, never a
 * string-position one: verifying producer and consumer independently is exactly how the inversion hid.
 *
 * The marker is omitted on `changes`, and when the head SHA is unavailable (`buildReviewedShaMarker` → '') the
 * gate fails open rather than reading a garbage marker.
 * #2844 — an acceptance also stamps WHO cleared it (`cleared-by-actor`, the harness session id — NOT the
 * free-text `--actor`, which is the point) and, when independence could NOT be established, says so in the
 * attribution. A clearance record that names only a self-declared actor is the "asserted but unenforced" state
 * this item exists to end; naming the id makes a later self-clear audit a machine read, not an archaeology.
 *
 * #2898 — THE CHANNEL IS AN INPUT, NOT A CONSTANT. This sentence used to end "via the Plateau Loop review
 * console" unconditionally, written when the module had exactly one caller. It now has four (the console, the

  // the validating `build*Marker` helpers. One sanitizer sits on the seam, so the guarantee is a property of
  // the SHAPE of this function rather than of a list of field names that has to be kept in sync.
  //
  // WHY NOT PER-FIELD. #2898 sanitized `--channel` and left `--actor` — its sibling, rendered by the very next
  // interpolation on the same line — reachable, and PR #1147's reviewer proved it: `--actor` alone forged a
  // `reviewed-sha` that `parseReviewedSha` read as gospel on a `changes` verdict (which appends no marker of
  // its own, so the forgery is the ONLY one in the body and last-match-wins hands it the win). Patching the
  // second field would have left the third. The per-input pattern re-opens on every new input by construction;
  // this does not.
  //
  // WHY SHAPE, NOT NAMES. The sanitizer neutralizes the HTML-comment SYNTAX, not a list of marker names. Every
  // MARKER this repo reads — `reviewed-sha`, `reviewed-diff`, `reviewed-contribution` (all three in
  // `we:scripts/lib/review-escalation.mjs`), the `cleared-human` MARKER (ditto), `cleared-by-actor` /
  // `authored-by-actor` (`we:scripts/lib/review-independence.mjs`), `drain-{park,skip,land}-reason`
  // (`we:scripts/merge-ai-prs.mjs`) — needs a literal `<!--` to open. Those parsers each hard-code their own
  // regex, so there is NO single list to derive a strip-set from; matching on the syntax is the only close that
  // covers a marker defined in a module this one does not import, or one invented after today.
  //
  // THE ONE PARSER THIS DOES NOT COVER, NAMED RATHER THAN LEFT IMPLICIT (#3060). `parseOperatorClearance`'s
  // OTHER regex, `CLEARED_HUMAN_PROSE_RE` in `we:scripts/lib/review-escalation.mjs`, is not marker-shaped — it
  // opens on the plain words "Cleared by … via `review-set-label.mjs --to=clear-human`", with no `<!--`
  // anywhere, so escaping HTML-comment delimiters gives it no purchase at all. A `body`/`reason` field shaped
  // like that sentence sailed straight through this boundary and parsed as a real clearance. It is closed
  // separately, by anchoring THAT regex to the start of the rendered body under the known `clear-human`
  // heading (a shape only this function's own preamble can produce, never a caller field, which is always
  // appended later) — see the note on `CLEARED_HUMAN_PROSE_RE` for the reasoning. Said again so it is not
  // missed: this render boundary is a complete answer for every `<!--`-opening marker, and an incomplete one for
  // prose-shaped parsers, which need their own per-parser argument.
  //
  // WHY ESCAPE RATHER THAN DELETE. `&lt;!--` renders as a visible `<!--` on GitHub, so a `/review` write-up
  // that legitimately QUOTES a prior round's marker still reads correctly (#983's re-accept comment did exactly
  // that) — it is simply inert to every parser, all of which scan the RAW body `gh pr view --json comments`

 *
 * IT NO LONGER STRIPS MARKERS, and that is the point (PR #1147 review). #2898 put a `reviewed-sha` strip here,
 * which made this function a SECOND home for a guarantee — and the first home never covered `--actor`, so the
 * hole stayed open in the field rendered by the same sentence. Marker neutralization now happens once, at

 * `REVIEWED_CONTRIBUTION_RE`, `CLEARED_HUMAN_RE` in `we:scripts/lib/review-escalation.mjs`; `actorMarkerRe` in
 * `we:scripts/lib/review-independence.mjs`; `drainReasonMarker` in `we:scripts/merge-ai-prs.mjs`). Remove every

 * is cased or spaced, and whether or not the marker was invented after this line was written. That is a
 * property of the marker SYNTAX, so it holds for markers this module cannot even see — which matters, because
 * those parsers each hard-code their own pattern and there is no shared registry to derive a strip-list from.
 *
 * WHAT IT IS NOT SUFFICIENT FOR (#3060, found FALSE against the code, not assumed true). Not every clearance
 * READER in this repo is marker-shaped: `parseOperatorClearance`'s prose fallback, `CLEARED_HUMAN_PROSE_RE`,
 * opens on the plain sentence "Cleared by … via `review-set-label.mjs --to=clear-human`" and contains no `<!--`
 * at all, so this escape gives it no purchase — a caller-supplied field shaped like that sentence sailed
 * straight through and parsed as a real clearance (`buildVerdictComment({to:'changes', body: thatSentence})`
 * against pre-#3060 code). It is closed at its own definition instead, by anchoring the regex to the exact
 * `clear-human` render shape rather than by widening what this function escapes — see the note beside
 * `CLEARED_HUMAN_PROSE_RE` in `we:scripts/lib/review-escalation.mjs`. Read "every marker" above as scoped to
 * marker-shaped parsers; it was never, and is not now, a claim about every parser this repo runs over a comment
 * body.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT A DELETE. `&lt;!--` renders as a literal `<!--` in GitHub-flavoured markdown, so a quoted
 * marker still SAYS what the write-up meant it to say; the parsers read the raw body, where it is inert. The
 * predecessor (`stripReviewedShaMarkers`) replaced one named marker with a backticked placeholder; this keeps
 * that readability property while covering every marker instead of one.
 *
 * ORDERING NOTE: `<!--` is escaped first, so the `--` it leaves behind cannot be re-consumed by the `-->` pass
 * (`&lt;!--` ends in `--`, and the closer pass needs `-->`).

 * the swap-first order of the day that left an ACCEPTED PR with no `reviewed-sha` marker; `acceptanceCoversHead`
 * fails OPEN on a missing marker, so it silently disarmed the staleness gate — exactly the partial state the
 * pre-flight exists to prevent. #2964 moved the comment ahead of the swap on a PR that is not already accepted,
 * so an under-count there now costs a failed run rather than a disarmed gate; on an ALREADY-accepted PR the swap
 * still goes first and the original consequence stands unchanged. `actor` and `reason` are argv and therefore

 * was actually passed rather than from a fixed-width placeholder that a long one would overrun. Over-estimating
 * is the safe direction: the cost is asking the operator to trim a body that would just barely have fitted.
 * #2844 — the projection is ALSO total over the independence outcomes, for the same reason it is total over the
 * targets: the `⚠️ Independence NOT established` note is extra chrome the earlier projection would have missed,
 * and under-counting it is precisely the 65,405–65,536 band failure M2 documents. Both unproven statuses render
 * a FIXED-length message (the proven `self-clear` never renders — the CLI refuses it before any write), so the
 * worst case is computed here from the real decider rather than guessed at with a placeholder width.
 * #2898 — `channel` joins them for the SAME reason: it is argv free text that lands in the rendered comment, so
