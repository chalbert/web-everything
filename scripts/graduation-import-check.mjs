/**
 * @file scripts/graduation-import-check.mjs
 * @description Epic #3443 (porting `origin/lane/mechanical-dispatcher` to `main` in slices) has hit the same
 *   failure TWICE: a slice's scoped TEST file imports a module owned by a LATER slice — one whose files are
 *   not on `main` yet and are not declared as a `blockedBy` dependency — so the slice cannot pass its own
 *   tests once it lands on `main`. #3901 had three test files like this (hand-fixed in PR #2567, moved to
 *   #3856/#3908/#3902); #3895 has two more, not yet fixed, at the snapshot this tool defaults to.
 *
 *   This checks EVERY OPEN card parented to the epic: for each `.mjs` file in its `scope:`, read the file AS IT
 *   STOOD AT THE PORT SNAPSHOT (`git show <sha>:<path>` — the port has not landed, so main's own working tree
 *   copy, if any, is irrelevant; the snapshot is the branch content about to be ported), statically extract its
 *   relative imports (`import … from './x.mjs'`, `import './x.mjs'`, and `import('./x.mjs')`), resolve each to a
 *   repo path, and classify it:
 *     - `on-main`   — the path already exists on `origin/main` (kept simple per the card: existence only, no
 *                     content diff — a file `main` already has can never be a slice-ordering hazard).
 *     - `own`       — declared in the SAME card's own `scope:`.
 *     - `blocker`   — declared in the `scope:` of a card this card's `blockedBy` reaches, transitively — landing
 *                     order is guaranteed by the epic's drain (Slice procedure rule 2), so this is safe.
 *     - `later:#N`  — declared in the `scope:` of some OTHER open card, with no declared `blockedBy` edge
 *                     guaranteeing it lands first. THIS is the hazard: nothing enforces #N lands before this
 *                     card, so the import may not exist on `main` when this card's tests run.
 *     - `unowned`   — not on `main`, not in any open card's `scope:` — likely a moved/renamed file or a scope
 *                     gap; flagged for a human, since there is no card to point a fix at.
 *
 *   Only `later` and `unowned` are findings. The proposed fix differs by file kind (`*.test.mjs` vs. impl):
 *     - a TEST file moves wholesale to the owning card that LANDS LAST among its `later` imports — moving it to
 *       the earliest-landing owner would just recreate the same hazard one hop down. "Lands last" is read off
 *       the `blockedBy` DAG as topological depth (`landingDepth`, counting only OPEN blockers — a resolved
 *       blocker has already landed and costs no further depth): #3895's own `telemetry-wiring.test.mjs` imports
 *       modules owned by #3902 (depth 1), #3905 (depth 4) and #3908 (depth 5) — #3908 wins, and that agrees with
 *       the epic card's own hand-written "Critical path: 3897 → 3902 → 3903 → 3906 → 3908 → 3487" and its Wave
 *       lettering (3902 is Wave B, 3905 is Wave C, 3908 is Wave D — D lands after B and C).
 *     - an IMPL file cannot be moved (its OWN card owns it) — the fix is to add the later owner(s) as
 *       `blockedBy`, which is exactly what the `blocker` classification then makes safe on the next run.
 *
 *   PURE CORE below (no fs/child_process/Date) is unit-tested on synthetic fixtures
 *   (`we:scripts/__tests__/graduation-import-check.test.mjs`). The IO shell (git/fs) and the CLI sit at the
 *   bottom, guarded by the `import.meta.url` check so importing this module for its exports never runs it.
 *
 * REUSES, NEVER REINVENTS: frontmatter scalar-field read/insert (`./backlog/frontmatter.mjs`, #2603-descended)
 *   and the ONE card-mutation writer (`./backlog/guarded-write.mjs`, #3034) — `--apply` never hand-rolls a
 *   frontmatter splice or a raw `writeFileSync` on a backlog card.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/graduation-import-check.mjs [--snapshot=600acc14f] [--parent=3443] [--json] [--apply]
