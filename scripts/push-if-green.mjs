/**
 * push-if-green.mjs — publish a repo's `main` to origin after a green gate (#2073).
 *
 * WHY: nothing in the batch / lane / close flow ever pushed `main`, so `origin/main` silently drifted
 * (observed 185 commits behind local after one parallel batch). The parallel orchestrator round-trips
 * `main` through the remote as throwaway `lane/_base` + `lane/*` refs (which it deletes) and lands merges
 * on the LOCAL primary checkout only; the serial `/batch` and close paths commit locally and (a leftover of
 * the pre-2026-06-29 never-push stance, now lifted) never pushed. Result: GitHub frozen, no off-machine
 * backup, no CI trigger, a fresh clone sees none of it.
 *
 * This is the ONE shared helper both the parallel integrator and the serial/close commit path call to
 * publish `main`. It generalizes the PUSH, not the LANE — lanes stay parallel-only (#2073 out-of-scope note).
 *
 * RULES (#2073):
 *  - Green-gate precondition — push a repo's `main` ONLY when that repo's gate is green. Either this script
 *    runs the gate itself (default), or the caller already ran it and passes `--assume-green` (the parallel
 *    integrator has just run the full per-repo gate on the merged tree — re-running would be wasteful).
 *    Never publish a red state.
 *  - Fast-forward ONLY, never --force. One local `main` serializes all merges (the integrator is a mutex),
 *    so pushes to origin/main are ff appends. A non-ff push (someone else advanced origin) ABORTS — it is
 *    never forced; the drift is recoverable, a later green push resolves it once origin is merged in.
 *  - Per-repo across the constellation (#96): WE + frontierui + plateau-app each push their OWN `main` after
 *    their OWN gated merge. Point `--repo` / cwd at the repo to publish; `--gate` names its gate command.
 *  - Only ever pushes the branch named `main` (or `--branch`), and only when HEAD is on it — never a lane ref,
 *    never a detached HEAD. Honors the standing guards: pushing `main` is allowed (never-push lifted
 *    2026-06-29); this script does NOT create branches or broad-stage.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/push-if-green.mjs                       # gate (vitest unit suite + check:standards, #2080) THIS repo, ff-push main if green
 *   node scripts/push-if-green.mjs --repo=~/workspace/frontierui --gate="npm run check:standards"
 *   node scripts/push-if-green.mjs --repo=~/workspace/plateau-app --gate="npm run build"
 *   node scripts/push-if-green.mjs --assume-green        # caller already gated green — skip the gate, just ff-push
 *   node scripts/push-if-green.mjs --dry-run             # gate + report the push decision, but do NOT push
 *   node scripts/push-if-green.mjs --json                # machine-readable result
 *
 * Flags:
 *   --repo=<path>     checkout to publish (default: the cwd's git toplevel)
 *   --gate=<cmd>      the gate command to run in that repo (default: "npm run test:unit && npm run check:standards")
 *   --branch=<ref>    the branch to publish (default: "main")
 *   --remote=<name>   the remote to push to (default: "origin")
 *   --assume-green    skip running the gate — the caller has already verified green (integrator path)
 *   --dry-run         run the gate + decide, but never push
 *   --json            emit a JSON result object on stdout
 *
 * Exit codes: 0 = pushed (or nothing-to-push / dry-run OK); 2 = gate red (nothing pushed); 3 = not ff /
 * wrong branch / push failed (nothing pushed). A non-zero exit means origin/<branch> was left UNTOUCHED.

// landed on `origin/main` by a raw push, so neither `scripts/lane-drain.mjs`'s `finalizeLand` nor

// fire — ever ran for them; the next drain pass's `numberPendingHashes` sweep (gated on that SAME pass also
// landing a local PR) raced the push and missed them too, and nothing surfaced the miss until a human ran
// `number-stranded` by hand. Numbering HERE, unconditionally, right before every push of `main`, closes the
// gap structurally instead of relying on every caller going through a PR: a hash-keyed backlog item can no
// longer reach `origin/main` without being numbered in the exact same push that lands it. A numbering
// failure REFUSES the push (fail closed) rather than landing an item this script already knows would be
// un-numbered — strictly better than the old best-effort-after-the-fact shape, since nothing reaches origin
