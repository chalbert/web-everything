/**
 * lane-pool.mjs — provision & refresh the persistent lane-clone pool for the #1933 clone-based
 * parallel batch orchestrator (slice 2).
 *
 * The #1933 model replaces guard-blocked `git worktree` isolation with N independent CLONES: each lane
 * is a full clone with its OWN HEAD (so the user-global git-branch guard, which protects the shared
 * checkout's HEAD, never fires on it), and convergence happens through the remote — a lane pushes its
 * work to a throwaway `lane/*` ref (allowed by the #1934 guard carve-out) and the central integrator
 * merges those into `main`. This script owns the *pool*: it creates/refreshes the clones the
 * orchestrator dispatches into; it does NOT dispatch, push, or merge (that's slice 3).
 *
 * Why a PERSISTENT pool (per #1933 design choice 1): re-cloning a large repo every batch is slow, so the
 * lanes are long-lived under `~/workspace/.lanes/<repo>/lane-<n>` and merely fetch + hard-reset to
 * origin/main between batches. Git OBJECTS are shared with the primary checkout via `git clone
 * --reference`, so a lane costs little disk and clones fast (objects come from the local primary, not the
 * network). Node deps (`node_modules`) are NOT shared — `ensureDeps` runs `npm ci` per lane on a fresh
 * clone or when the lockfile changes, so each lane can run its own gate.
 *
 * Repo-parameterized: the pool is keyed by repo NAME, so cross-repo slice 4 (lanes of
 * frontierui / plateau-app — the constellation) reuses this unchanged via `--repo=<checkout-path>`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/lane-pool.mjs provision --count=N [--acquirable] [--no-install] [--force]   # ensure N lanes exist (clone missing) + refresh all + ensure deps + ensure the WE pool's FUI render-sibling (#2166); --acquirable grows PAST foreign-leased lanes so N ACQUIRABLE ones result (#2426)
 *   node scripts/lane-pool.mjs refresh           [--no-install] [--force]     # fetch + hard-reset existing lanes to origin/main (no creation)
 *   node scripts/lane-pool.mjs status  [--json]                     # per-lane: path / head / clean / behind origin/main / deps / lease
 *   node scripts/lane-pool.mjs list    [--json] [--acquirable]      # existing lane paths (for the orchestrator to dispatch into); --acquirable filters out foreign-leased / busy lanes (#2426)
 *   node scripts/lane-pool.mjs path    --lane=N                     # print one lane's absolute path
 *   node scripts/lane-pool.mjs acquire [--purpose=<slug>] [--session=<slug>] [--lane=N] [--item=NNN[,NNN…]] [--ttl-minutes=N] [--no-reset] [--no-reap] [--base=<ref>] [--scope=<repo:path,...>] [--reserve] [--json]  # #2275 lease a free lane (exclusive) + reset to origin/main (or, with #2386 --base=<ref>, to a predecessor lane's pushed tip); stdout = its path. #2748: BEFORE selecting, a reaper backstop reclaims any PROVABLY-DEAD ghost lease in the pool (item resolved on main, or PR merged/closed) so a finished-but-unreleased lane never blocks a fresh dispatch — the pool ACTS on the ghost the board only flags; --no-reap opts out. #2413: --purpose=workflow-lane MARKS the lease (workflowLane:true) → the guard requires a sibling to assert its minted slug before a destructive op. #2560: --scope=<repo:path,...> declares this lane's ADVISORY predicted file-scope — persisted into the marker (the live scope-lease collector reads it) + warns on overlap, but NEVER gates the acquire (the whole-clone lease is the real lock). #2616: --item=NNN records this lane's item → lane in the lane-ports registry (same as `map`) so conveyor-state's health-stall scan can flag a genuinely stalled lane — the self-serve population a conveyor delivery agent needs (nothing else calls `map` for it). #2350: --reserve (requires --lane=N) mints a PERMANENT reserved lane — no TTL, never stale, off-limits to acquire/refresh/provision (even --force); dropped only by `release --release-reserved`. #2997: EVERY acquire now mints a per-holder `holder` slug into the lease and prints it (stderr + --json `holder`) — the one signal that separates this holder from a SIBLING agent of the same session, which `ownerSession` cannot; assert it as `--session=<slug>` (release) or `LANE_SESSION=<slug>` (a destructive git op) whenever a sibling of your session also holds a live lane. #2997 r2: --adopt also stamps YOU as the lane's OCCUPANT (`workerSession`) — pass it when the process running this acquire is the one that will work in the lane, omit it when you are leasing on someone else's behalf (they run `adopt` instead).
 *   node scripts/lane-pool.mjs adopt   --lane=N [--force] [--json]   # #2997 r2 the dispatcher → worker OCCUPANCY hand-off: declare the CALLING session the agent working in lane-N (stamps `workerSession`), which is what arms guard-lane.mjs's Edit/Write refusal against every OTHER session. `ownerSession` cannot do this job — it records whoever RAN `acquire`, which for a dispatched lane is the dispatcher, not the worker. Idempotent; a lane already declared-occupied by a different LIVE session needs --force (a deliberate takeover, which names who is displaced).
 *   node scripts/lane-pool.mjs release (--lane=N | --all | --all-pools (--session=<slug> | --item=<num>)) [--session=<slug>] [--pool=<name>] [--force] [--release-reserved]   # #2275 hand a leased lane back to the pool (own lease, or --force); #2350 --release-reserved is the deliberate un-reserve for a PERMANENT reserved lane (--force alone never drops one); #2667 --all-pools --session sweeps EVERY pool under POOL_ROOT and releases that session's leases (cross-locus couple cleanup in one call), and --pool=<name> selects a pool by dir-name (no checkout path needed); #2748 --all-pools --item=<num> is the by-ITEM sweep the drain's release-on-land uses (matches every lease whose session encodes that item number — needs no exact slug); #2997 a CONTESTED lease (another live lease — in ANY pool under POOL_ROOT, per r2 — shares its ownerSession, i.e. a sibling agent of yours holds a lane) is never released on the ownerSession match alone — pass `--session=<the holder slug acquire printed>` or `--force`. A STALE lease is never contested (r2): a dead holder has nothing to prove, so an expired lease releases without --force exactly as on main.
 *   node scripts/lane-pool.mjs remove  (--lane=N | --all)           # tear down lane(s); #2350 REFUSES a reserved lane (even --all/--force) — deliberate teardown is `remove --lane=N --release-reserved`
 *   node scripts/lane-pool.mjs map     --lane=N --item=NNN[,NNN…]   # register item(s) → lane page-port (#2139 proxy)
 *   node scripts/lane-pool.mjs unmap   (--item=NNN[,…] | --lane=N | --all)   # drop lane-ports registry entries
 *
 * Repo / pool overrides (apply to any command):
 *   --repo=<path>        a checkout to derive the lane repo from (default: the cwd's git toplevel)
 *   --pool=<name>        (#2667) select a pool DIRECTLY by its dir-name under POOL_ROOT — the read/release
 *                        selector (status / list / path / release) that needs only the poolDir, no checkout path
 *                        or origin URL (e.g. release a plateau-app-pool lease from the WE checkout)
 *   --origin=<url>       clone source (default: that checkout's `origin` remote URL)
 *   --reference=<path>   object-sharing reference repo for `git clone --reference` (default: --repo path)
 *   --name=<slug>        pool key under the root (default: derived from the origin URL basename)
 *   --branch=<ref>       integration branch (default: detected origin/HEAD, else `main`)
 *   env LANE_POOL_ROOT   pool root (default: ~/workspace/.lanes)
 *
 * SAFETY (#2267): a lane is safe scratch ONLY for work that is clean-and-up-to-date, or that this guard
 * has skipped. `refresh`/`provision` never silently discard a lane that is DIRTY (uncommitted edits) or
 * AHEAD of origin/<branch> (locally-committed-but-unpushed commits) — such a lane is SKIPPED (left
 * untouched) and reported, because `reset --hard` + `clean -fd` would otherwise destroy that work with no
 * recovery. Pass --force to restore the old unconditional reset-everything behavior for a dirty/ahead lane.
 * The only state a lane can rely on surviving a concurrent refresh/provision is what has ALREADY been
 * pushed to origin (i.e. landed via `pr-land` onto its `lane/*` ref, per #1934) — treat anything else as
 * ephemeral and push early.
 *
 * SAFETY (#2275/#2337): a LIVE lease (an exclusive hold stamped by `acquire`, presumed alive within TTL) is
 * a STRONGER guard than dirty/ahead — it protects an active consumer, not just tree residue. `--force`
 * overrides the dirty/ahead staleness guard but NEVER a live lease: `refresh --force` / `provision --force`
 * SKIP a live-leased lane with a loud log (never reset it); `acquire --lane=N --force` on a live-leased lane
 * HARD-FAILS, pointing at the deliberate override — `release --force` (drop the lease), then re-acquire. No
 * separate `--force-lease` flag exists; `release --force` is the one escape hatch for a live lease.
 *
 * SAFETY (#2350): a RESERVED lease (`acquire --reserve --lane=N`) is STRONGER still than a live lease — it is a
 * PERMANENT hold with no TTL that never goes stale, so it is off-limits to acquire (auto-pick skips it; an
 * explicit `acquire --lane=N` HARD-FAILS on it, even with `--force`) AND to `refresh`/`provision` `reset --hard`
 * (skipped forever, even with `--force`). It is the dedicated persistent memory-lane primitive (#2301/#2350):
 * a durable slot the running session can write through without a lane→PR round-trip, kept off the primary
 * checkout and off the recyclable pool. `--force` NEVER drops it; the ONE deliberate un-reserve is
 * `release --lane=N --release-reserved`. (NOTE: this script only PROVISIONS the reserved lane; the live repoint
 * of the machine-global `~/.claude/…/memory` symlink at it is the SUPERVISED, human-gated half of #2350.)

// Every WE grid page SSRs through the pinned FUI build-artifact, resolved by
// `scripts/lib/component-render-build-hook.cjs` at the FIXED relative path `../frontierui/dist/tools/
// component-render/cli.mjs` — i.e. a `frontierui` checkout SIBLING of the WE repo root. In the primary
// checkout that sibling is `~/workspace/frontierui`; but a lane clone lives at `<poolDir>/lane-N`, whose
// parent (`<poolDir>`) has no `frontierui` — so `build:docs` / `eleventy --serve` / any rendered
// verification HARD-FAILS in a solo/interactive WE lane ("pinned FUI artifact missing"). The #1943
// orchestrator only provisions per-repo pools for items whose *impl* spans FUI; this render dependency is
// UNCONDITIONAL (independent of whether the edited item touches FUI), so it can't be gated behind that
// affected-repo detection — the pool itself must carry the sibling. A plain `plateau-app` sibling similarly
// un-breaks a lane's Vite dev-panel import (`vite.config.mts` → `../plateau-app/…`).
//
// Original fix (#2166): a SYMLINK at `<poolDir>/frontierui` to the primary checkout's real `frontierui`
// sibling. Ratified in #2282 (docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#pool-siblings-real-built-clones) and
// generalized here (#2349): the pool-root sibling is now a REAL, PUSHABLE git clone, not a symlink — one
// clone per sibling repo serves BOTH consumers at the same `../<name>` path a lane resolves — WE-lane
// render reads its BUILT `dist/`, and the drain's cross-repo rebase-drop (`merge-ai-prs.mjs`
// `siblingCloneDir`, unchanged — it already resolves `../<name>`) fetches/pushes its `origin`. Safe to
// share: rebase-drop is pure git plumbing (merge-tree → commit-tree → push, no checkout), so it only
// mutates git objects/refs — disjoint from render's `dist/` reads. The symlink's one lost behavior: render
// no longer reflects the primary checkout's uncommitted FUI WIP, only its committed `main` — freshness
// ownership moves to this provisioner, which rebuilds `dist/` (via the sibling's own `build:tools`, where
// it has one — frontierui does, plateau-app doesn't) on every provision/refresh.
//
// Idempotent: a clean, up-to-date clone is fetched + fast-forwarded + rebuilt (cheap — ~1.2s for FUI); a
// missing clone is created (`--reference` the primary sibling for fast local object-sharing, same pattern
// as `cloneLane`); a legacy pre-#2282 symlink is replaced with a real clone; a DIRTY or AHEAD clone (like a
// lane, #2267) is left untouched rather than reset-away, since it is now real, pushable, mutable state.

 * may treat an "ahead" lane as recyclable rather than firing the #2267 never-recycle-unpushed-work guard?
 *
 * The first cut answered this from LOCAL remote-tracking refs alone (`for-each-ref --contains=HEAD
 * refs/remotes`). That is unsound: a local `refs/remotes/origin/lane/*` ref is exactly as stale as the
 * `origin/<branch>` ref the check exists to distrust. A `lane/*` branch deleted on origin after landing (the
 * normal end of a lane's life) leaves its remote-tracking ref behind locally, so HEAD still "contains" into
 * it and the guard clears — handing a hard `reset --hard` to a lane whose commits exist NOWHERE on the
 * remote. The failure mode of a wrong answer here is destroyed work, so it must be checked against the live
 * remote, not a cache.
 *
 * `remoteShas` is the live `ls-remote` snapshot (taken ONCE per acquire pass, and only when some lane looks
 * ahead — so the no-per-lane-fetch cost profile is preserved in the common case). HEAD counts as pushed only
 * if it is a live remote tip or an ancestor of one. Fails CLOSED on any git fault: no proof ⇒ stay protected.
 *
 * #2920 — this used to be a per-remote-head `merge-base --is-ancestor` fan-out (one spawn per live remote
 * head, per ahead lane): on the real 38-lane pool with 29 remote heads that was 677 git spawns / ~30s for
 * one acquire pass. Containment is answerable in ONE spawn: `rev-list HEAD --not <shas...>` walks HEAD's
 * ancestry once, excluding everything reachable from ANY of the given shas — empty output means HEAD (and
 * everything under it) is already reachable from some remote head, i.e. exactly the OR-across-heads the old
 * loop computed. `--ignore-missing` tolerates a remoteShas entry whose object isn't present in this lane's
 * local object DB (e.g. a branch this lane never fetched) by dropping it from the exclusion set rather than
 * failing the whole spawn — the same fail-open-per-candidate behavior the old per-sha loop had (a missing
 * object just couldn't prove anything, but didn't stop OTHER candidates from proving it). Verified against
 * the live pool + synthetic cases (fully pushed / one unpushed commit / deleted remote ref / detached HEAD /
 * no remotes / empty repo / unresolvable sha mixed with a valid one) — zero verdict flips vs. the old loop.
