/**
 * fetch-parked.mjs — dump a stable per-PR review bundle reviewers currently hand-assemble from scattered `gh`
 * calls (#2434, one of three drain fetch/state helpers under `scripts/`).
 *
 * WHY: when the drain parks a PR for review, a reviewer re-derives the same shape by hand — `gh pr view` for the
 * body/files/state/labels, `gh pr checks` (or the rollup) for green/red, `gh pr diff` for the change — across
 * one or several PR numbers. This is the ONE read-only tool that emits that bundle as a stable JSON array, so
 * the console / reviewer reads one shape, never re-invents the plumbing.
 *
 * Split mirrors the house idiom (`scripts/review-detail.mjs`, `scripts/push-if-green.mjs`): a PURE
 * `assembleParked({view, diff})` distills an already-parsed `gh pr view … --json` object plus the raw diff into
 * the contract; a thin impure CLI does the two `gh` calls per PR and prints. Green/red is single-sourced through
 * `classifyChecks` from `./pr-land.mjs` (the SAME truth pr-land waits for) — the rollup is first normalized to
 * the `gh pr checks` bucket shape classifyChecks reads (`rollupToCheckRows`). Review class reuses
 * `REVIEW_LABELS`/`hasReviewLabel` from `./lib/review-escalation.mjs`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/fetch-parked.mjs 472 471            # JSON array, one entry per PR (default — this is a data tool)
 *   node scripts/fetch-parked.mjs 12 --repo=~/workspace/frontierui   # run gh in another repo's checkout (couples span repos)
 *   node scripts/fetch-parked.mjs 472 --json         # explicit; identical to the default
 *
 * Flags:
 *   <num…>          one or more PR numbers (positional)
 *   --repo=<path>   filesystem checkout to run gh in (default: cwd) — PRs may live in WE/frontierui/plateau-app
 *   --json          emit the JSON array (default; the flag is accepted for symmetry with the other helpers)
 *
 * Tolerant of a missing PR: emits an `{number, error}` entry for it and continues the batch (never crashes).
 * Exit 0 always when at least one number was given; 2 on a usage error (no numbers).

 * push to the author's branch: `['size']` bands to `low` (editor ON) while `['size','blast-radius']` scores
 * 2 + 3 = 5 → `high` (editor OFF), so ONE dropped bullet flips the gate. PR #1018 — the PR the #2908 ruling is
