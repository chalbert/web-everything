/**
 * converge-daemon-pass.mjs — ONE scheduled pass of the converge daemon (#2572, ruling R7 of 2026-08-08).
 *
 * WHY: `review-runner.mjs` (#2830) is the converge daemon's shadow payload and it is complete — but NOTHING
 * schedules it. No workflow, no npm script, no conveyor caller; it is hand-run, so it writes nothing and, more
 * to the point, it *observes* nothing. The enforce flip's readiness predicate needs a clean shadow track record
 * that can only be earned by running unattended for a while, so "schedule it" is the last thing standing
 * between here and that record. This file is the payload half of the substrate; `converge-daemon-install.mjs`
 * is the schedule half.
 *
 * SHAPE — a periodic ONE-SHOT, deliberately not a resident daemon. The shadow pass is a plain CLI that
 * discovers, folds a ledger, prints and exits; it already holds its own TTL singleton lease, so overlapping
 * fires are a benign no-op. A resident `KeepAlive` process (the drain daemon's shape, #2501 Fork B) buys
 * nothing until the ENFORCE era, when the pass spawns a panel + editor subagent and wants to survive across
 * them. Until then a `StartInterval` job is the whole daemon, and it costs one plist.
 *
 * THE LEDGER IS THE ONE NON-OBVIOUS WIRE. `runShadowPass` folds the durable jury log, which lives in a
 * WORKING TREE at `<root>/.conveyor/jury/` and is gitignored — so a dedicated daemon clone has its own EMPTY
 * one, every PR folds fail-closed to keep-parked, and the soak proves nothing. The pass therefore points
 * `CONVEYOR_JURY_DIR` at the tree the convergence loop actually writes (the operator's primary checkout) and
 * reads it READ-ONLY. That indirection is also the migration seam: when the ledger becomes a shared store, this
 * env var is the only thing that changes, and the daemon stops caring which host runs it.
 *
 * SAFETY: the pass runs `review-runner.mjs`, which refuses `--enforce` and guarantees `mutations: 0`. This
 * wrapper adds no flags that could act, and its refresh step (`fetch` + `reset --hard` + `clean`) is why it
 * REFUSES to run against the operator's primary checkout — see `assertNotPrimary`.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/converge-daemon-pass.mjs                 # refresh the clone, run one shadow pass, append the log
 *   node scripts/converge-daemon-pass.mjs --no-refresh    # skip the git refresh (run the code as it sits)
 *   node scripts/converge-daemon-pass.mjs --print-config   # resolve + print the config, do nothing else
