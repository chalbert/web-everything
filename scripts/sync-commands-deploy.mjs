/**
 * sync-commands-deploy.mjs — deploy `.claude/commands/` to the machine-global `~/.claude/commands`.
 *
 * THE GAP THIS CLOSES. Skills and agent-memory each have a source of truth OUTSIDE `.claude/`
 * (`skills-src/`, `agent-memory-src/`) with `.claude/` symlinking in, so the repo-local copy cannot drift,
 * and `sync-skills-deploy.mjs` (#2579) carries the repo-local copy out to the user's machine-global tree.
 * Slash commands got neither: `.claude/commands/*.md` are plain tracked files with no deploy path, so they
 * are live only in a session whose PRIMARY directory is this repo. From a sibling repo, a lane, or any
 * cloud VM, twenty commands silently do not exist.
 *
 * WHY NOT SYMLINK THEM, THE WAY SKILLS ARE SYMLINKED. The symlink in `.claude/skills` points INWARD (repo →
 * repo) and is safe. Pointing the machine-global tree at the repo is a different thing, and this repo has
 * already paid for it: see the notes above `assertInsideRoot` in sync-skills-deploy.mjs, where a symlinked
 * intermediate under the deploy root let writes escape it entirely, a `destDir` that was itself a symlink
 * made the containment check a tautology that overwrote `skills-src/` itself, and a 2-node symlink cycle
 * ELOOP-hung the post-merge hook, wedging `git pull`. Beyond the bugs, `~/.claude/commands` is the
 * OPERATOR's directory: it may hold their own commands, and a symlinked directory cannot hold both. Copying
 * keeps the user's tree theirs — additive by default, deletion opt-in, drift reported.
 *
 * REUSE, NOT A SECOND IMPLEMENTATION. Every risky part — containment, the opt-in prune, the tracked-files-
 * only rule, the drift report — is imported from sync-skills-deploy.mjs. The only thing this file adds is
 * the shape difference: skills are a directory per unit, commands are FLAT `.md` files, so this deploys one
 * unit whose tracked files happen to sit at depth 1.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/sync-commands-deploy.mjs            # sync when ~/.claude/commands already exists
 *   node scripts/sync-commands-deploy.mjs --all       # deploy even if the operator has no commands tree yet
 *   node scripts/sync-commands-deploy.mjs --check     # report drift only, write nothing; exit 1 if any
 *   node scripts/sync-commands-deploy.mjs --dry-run   # print planned actions, write nothing; exit 0
 *   node scripts/sync-commands-deploy.mjs --prune     # ALSO delete deploy-root files no longer tracked
 *
 * WE_COMMANDS_DEPLOY_DIR overrides the deploy root (tests / a non-default machine layout).
