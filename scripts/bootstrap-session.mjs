/**
 * bootstrap-session.mjs — make a machine ready to work the constellation, idempotently.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. The instruction layer already travels: `AGENTS.md` is committed, so any session that
 * opens this repo reads the rules. MACHINE STATE does not travel. A fresh Claude Code cloud VM has the
 * repo on disk and nothing else wired: `~/.claude/skills/` is empty of this repo's skills, so `/drain`,
 * `/jury`, `/pr` and the rest are inert; the sibling repos of the constellation are not cloned; and the
 * lane pool the laptop relies on does not exist and should not. Every VM session so far has rediscovered
 * that by hand, differently. This script is the one answer, in code rather than prose — prose gets
 * half-followed, an idempotent script cannot be.
 *
 * HOST-AWARE, because the right setup differs. On the LAPTOP the lane pool, the reserved memory lane and
 * the user-level guard are the environment, and a skills deploy is deliberately scoped so a WE-specific
 * orchestration skill never leaks into an unrelated repo (see sync-skills-deploy.mjs). On an EPHEMERAL VM
 * none of that holds: there are no unrelated repos and the box is reclaimed on idle, so this script writes
 * freely rather than asking consent about state nothing outlives.
 *
 * WHAT IS *NOT* DIFFERENT — and this paragraph used to say the opposite. It claimed the branch guard "is not
 * installed", so "provisioning a pool costs an `npm ci` per lane and buys nothing". Both halves are false.
 * The USER-LEVEL installer (#3074) is skipped, but `guard-lane.mjs` itself ships in the COMMITTED
 * `.claude/settings.json` `PreToolUse` hooks and denies every `Edit`/`Write` to a primary checkout here
 * exactly as on a laptop — so a lane is the ONLY writable surface, and a pool is required rather than
 * pointless. (`--reference` against the `--depth 1` clones was also *fatal* rather than merely unhelpful,
 * and the pool root mis-derived from `$HOME`; both fixed in `lane-pool.mjs` by #3265.) The `lanes` step below
 * still SKIPS — a `SessionStart` hook must not block for minutes cloning lanes — but it now names the
 * command instead of explaining why you do not need one.
 *
 * WHERE THIS LIVES IS NOT WHERE IT STAYS. The lane and delivery machinery this sets up is Plateau's
 * product; WE is a PUBLIC peer that happens to dogfood it, not the constellation's hub. So nothing here
 * hard-codes its own home: the checkout it is in is DERIVED (`selfKey`), the siblings come from the shared
 * constellation table rather than a local literal, and the skills CLI is looked up self-then-siblings so
 * the two halves can move in either order. Relocating this file should be a `git mv`, not a rewrite.
 *
 * WHAT IT NEVER DOES. It does not clone the sibling repos: in a cloud session they arrive through the
 * harness's `add_repo` + credential-proxied clone, which no script here can or should perform. It reports
 * which are missing and names the tool. It does not touch the reserved memory lane or repoint the
 * machine-global memory symlink — that is #2350's supervised, human-gated half, and a script that moved
 * it silently would be the wipe that decision exists to prevent.
 *
 * CONSENT: A DURABLE HOST IS REPORTED ON, NEVER MUTATED IMPLICITLY. The committed project SessionStart hook
 * means this runs the moment anyone opens the repo, so a default run must not reach outside the repository.
 * On a workstation it reports what it would do and stops; `install` is the explicit opt-in, `uninstall` the
 * reverse. An ephemeral cloud VM writes freely — its `$HOME` is a container reclaimed on idle, so there is
 * no durable state to consent about, and the value of a session that configures itself is the whole point.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/bootstrap-session.mjs             # report; applies only on an ephemeral host
 *   node scripts/bootstrap-session.mjs --check     # report drift only, write nothing; exit 1 if any
 *   node scripts/bootstrap-session.mjs --dry-run   # print the plan, write nothing; exit 0
 *   node scripts/bootstrap-session.mjs --json      # machine-readable summary on stdout
 *   node scripts/bootstrap-session.mjs --laptop    # force the non-ephemeral plan (override detection)
 *   node scripts/bootstrap-session.mjs --ephemeral # force the ephemeral plan (override detection)
 *   node scripts/bootstrap-session.mjs install     # apply on ANY host (the explicit opt-in)
 *   node scripts/bootstrap-session.mjs uninstall   # drop the SessionStart registration

 * hard-coded basename instead — `frontierui/vite.config.mts` does `resolve(__dirname, '../webeverything')`,
 * and plateau-app's tsconfig `paths` and FUI's intent-resolver plugin do the same. A cloud VM clones from the
