/**
 * #2899 A4 — STRANDED-ITEM SWEEP: find delivered work still sitting `open`/`active`.
 *
 * WHY. When a land assigns an item's `<NNN>` but never flips its `status:` (the #2899 defect), the card stays
 * permanently eligible: every future batch that packs by leverage re-selects it, and whoever draws it pays a
 * full claim + lane + investigate cycle to discover the work is already on main. #2880 and #2450 each cost
 * exactly that. This sweep finds the ones already stranded, so they are closed rather than re-packed.
 *
 * THE SIGNAL, AND WHY IT IS NOT FRONTMATTER. The tempting offline inference — "numerically named + still
 * carries a `bornAs` hash ⇒ its lane landed" — is WRONG, and wrong in the noisy direction. `numberPendingHashes`
 * numbers every pending hash file present on main at land, including items that some OTHER lane merely FILED in
 * passing (a prevention item, a spin-off). Run against this corpus that rule flags 218 of 2874 cards, almost all
 * of them correctly-open items that were never delivered at all. A report that cannot be trusted is not a heal.
 *
 * So the sweep uses the signal the acceptance criterion names: **a MERGED PR that actually delivered this
 * item**, matched on the lane ref / title / manifest the drain itself writes. One `gh pr list` for the whole
 * corpus, then pure matching — no per-item network call.
 *
 * REPORT, NEVER BULK-FLIP — for the general `gh`-sourced match above. A genuinely broader-scoped item may
 * legitimately outlive its first PR: it landed a slice and has more to do. That is indistinguishable from a
 * stranding without reading the item, so THAT signal writes nothing and hands the triage to a human.
 *
 * #3916 — ONE exception, `--apply`: a card whose id is the trailing `(#NNNN)` of a real commit already
 * reachable from `main` (never a `drain: ...` housekeeping commit — see `commitSubjectDeliversItem`'s own doc)
 * is unambiguous enough to flip automatically, through the drain's own `resolveLandedItem`
 * (`scripts/lane-drain.mjs`, #2748) — never a second resolver. Everything short of that bar stays report-only.
 *
 * The core (`prDeliveredItem` / `sweepStrandings` / `commitSubjectDeliversItem` / `autoResolvableStrandings`)
 * is PURE; the CLI is the only thing that touches fs/network/git.
 *
 * Usage:
 *   node scripts/backlog-stranded-sweep.mjs [--json] [--limit=N]             # report only (default)
 *   node scripts/backlog-stranded-sweep.mjs --apply [--json]                 # ALSO auto-resolve the strict subset
 *     [--log-limit=N]  cap the origin/main commit-log window the strict check reads (default 400)

 * #3916 — AUTO-RESOLVE, the one exception to "REPORT, NEVER BULK-FLIP" above. Pure.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `#3916` graduated onto `main` (commit `092df91c4`, "Graduate test setup, heavy-command
 * admission and file-locks from lane/mechanical-dispatcher (#3916)") but the resolve-on-land path
 * (`scripts/merge-ai-prs.mjs`'s `deliveredItemNumsFromPr`, #2899) never even saw it: a guard meant to exclude a
 * doc-only PR misfired on a QUOTED citation inside the PR body ("... 'already landed, no code change' precedent
 * ...") and dropped the credited id before it ever reached `landedThisPass`, so the card sat `status: active`
 * indefinitely with real, merged, on-`main` work. That extractor bug is fixed at its source
 * (`scripts/lib/open-pr-items.mjs`), but resolve-on-land is inherently heuristic (it reads PR ref/title/body
 * text), so this sweep is the backstop for the NEXT heuristic miss, not just this one.
 *
 * WHY THIS ONE SIGNAL IS SAFE TO ACT ON AUTOMATICALLY (unlike `sweepStrandings` above, which only ever
 * reports). `commitSubjectDeliversItem` requires a commit **reachable from `main` itself** (ground truth, no
 * `gh` staleness/window-truncation risk) whose subject names the card's OWN id as the delivery-commit
 * convention this repo already uses (`Graduate ... (#3916)`, `WE #NNN: ...`) — never a bare mention. Excluding
 * every `drain: ...` commit matters: `drain: resolve #3917 on land (#2748)` / `drain: JIT-number x…→#4053 at
 * land (#2288)` are MECHANICAL housekeeping whose trailing `(#NNNN)` cites the EPIC that authorized the
 * automation, not something that commit delivers — without the exclusion, every routine drain commit would
 * misread as "delivering" #2748/#2288 forever.
 *
 * NEVER GUESS. A card with no matching commit is left OUT of this set — it still surfaces in
 * `sweepStrandings`'s general (report-only, hand-triaged) output exactly as before. This function decides
 * WHICH cards are safe to flip; the actual flip is the drain's own `resolveLandedItem`
 * (`scripts/lane-drain.mjs`, #2748) — this module never re-implements that mutation.
