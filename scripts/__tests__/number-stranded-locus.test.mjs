/**
 * #1961 — `number-stranded`'s lane refusal, tested at the level that actually runs.
 *
 * Round 2 asked for the WIRING, not the predicate: a tested `isLaneLocus` that `numberStranded()` failed to
 * call would still ship a guard that never fires. Round 3's juror then found the guard was asking the WRONG
 * QUESTION — it tested `process.cwd()` while the repair writes to `ROOT`, this script's own checkout. Invoked
 * by absolute path from an unrelated directory the guard passed and the verb went on to renumber the LANE's
 * cards, which is precisely the half-applied rename it exists to prevent. Confirmed against the running code
 * before the fix: it offered to number 2 real cards.
 *
 * So both cases below decouple cwd from ROOT deliberately, by planting a COPY of the scripts tree at a
 * chosen locus (the #2274 throwaway-clone substrate `we:scripts/backlog/__tests__/resolve-parent-cli.test.mjs`
 * uses) and running it from somewhere else entirely. A test that only ever runs `cd <checkout> && node
 * scripts/backlog.mjs` cannot tell the two apart — which is why the hole survived two rounds.
