/**
 * @file publish-secret-gate.test.mjs — ADVERSARIAL proof of the #3015 publish-seam secret gate.
 *
 * THE ACCEPTANCE THIS FILE OWNS. "The scrub is called earlier in the code" is not evidence that a secret
 * cannot be committed. So every test here drives a REAL write path end-to-end — the actual `backlog.mjs`
 * CLI as a subprocess, the actual `backlog-guard.mjs`/`check-memory.mjs` PreToolUse hooks fed a real hook
 * event on stdin, the actual `check-standards.mjs` corpus sweep — pushes a known synthetic marker through
 * it, and then asserts against the FILESYSTEM that the marker did not land. The four gates cover the four
 * ways content actually reaches a committed file:
 *
 *   1. the backlog CLI funnel   (`scaffold`/`resolve`/… → `writeBacklogMd`)      — a Bash-invoked `fs` write
 *   2. the backlog Edit/Write hook (`backlog-guard.mjs --pre`)                    — an agent editing a card
 *   3. the memory Edit/Write hook (`check-memory.mjs --pre`)                      — the ONLY memory gate
 *   4. the `check:standards` corpus sweep                                         — the bypass backstop
 *
 * Each gate has a companion NEGATIVE case that pushes ordinary, correct content — a `we:`-prefixed repo
 * path citation, the shape #883 and the #2978 Grounding filter both REQUIRE — through the same path and
 * asserts it passes. A gate that blocks correct authorship is a gate that gets turned off.
 *
 * THE MARKER IS SYNTHETIC. `sk-SYNTHETIC0000TESTMARKERNOTREAL` was never issued by any service and matches
 * no live credential; it is shaped only to trip the `sk-`-prefix rule. No real secret appears in this repo.

// a subprocess run here would prove nothing about the sweep and everything about the fixture. Instead the
// pure rule is exercised directly, and a separate assertion pins that `check-standards.mjs` still CALLS it —
// two OF THE WAYS this backstop can break (rule stops detecting; rule stops being wired) each have a test.
// A third way — the walk's glob silently matching zero files (e.g. `.endsWith('.md')` becoming
// `.endsWith('.mdx')`) — would still look "wired" from the call-site regex alone, so the wiring test below
// also pins the real call site's filter IN CONTEXT (not a bare global regex — this file has several other
// `.md` walks a global pattern would blindly match) and asserts the walk actually finds files.
