/**
 * lane-resume.mjs — discover STUCK ready-to-merge lanes and plan their takeover (#2200).
 *
 * The consumer side of a recurring situation: a producer (`/workflow`, `/batch`) opens a
 * `ready-to-merge` PR per item, but some never land — a conflict with a peer that landed first, a red
 * required `test` (the lane shipped a real bug), or a `blockedBy` item that isn't landed yet. `/drain`
 * only lands couples that are ALREADY ready; it skips these. This engine finds them, says WHY each is
 * stuck, and orders them so the `/resume` skill can hand each to a finisher subagent (seeded with the
 * EXISTING lane ref — reuse the ~done work, repair only the broken part) and then land it via the
 * normal drain transport.
 *
 * Subcommands:
 *   node scripts/lane-resume.mjs discover [--json]     # classify + blockedBy-order every stuck lane
 *   node scripts/lane-resume.mjs discover --this-repo  # scope to the cwd repo only (default = all 3 repos)
 *   node scripts/lane-resume.mjs discover --repos=owner/a,owner/b   # an explicit repo set
 *   node scripts/lane-resume.mjs discover --window-days=N   # pr-missing age window (default 7; see PR-MISSING)
 *   node scripts/lane-resume.mjs land <pr> [--repo=owner/name] [--dry-run] [--json]   # land ONE stuck lane PR (#2202)
 *   node scripts/lane-resume.mjs open <laneRef> [--repo=owner/name] [--json]   # open the PR for a pushed-but-PR-less lane ref (#xcf4556)
 *   node scripts/lane-resume.mjs rebuild-plan [--spec=<file>|-]     # plan a repaired link's descendant-tail rebuild (#2396); `landed` derives from positive on-main proof (bornAs / status:resolved) when not supplied
 *   node scripts/lane-resume.mjs rebuild <laneRef> --onto=<sha>     # rebuild ONE descendant tip onto the repaired parent tip (#2396)
 *
 * MULTI-REPO (#2383 — parity with `/drain`'s #2287 constellation-default): `discover` sweeps ALL 3
 * constellation repos BY DEFAULT (WE + frontierui + plateau-app, self first), reusing the SAME `resolveRepos`
 * from `merge-ai-prs.mjs`. Every gh call is `--repo`-scoped; a remote lane reads its manifest via the GitHub
 * API and lands through that repo's sibling clone (deferred to the drain, #2263). The backlog is WE-global, so
 * a remote lane's `blockedBy` still resolves against the one WE backlog. Opt out with `--this-repo`.
 *
 * PR-MISSING (#xcf4556) — a lane can finish (commit + resolve its card + `git push`) and still never get a PR:
 * the live case was a `/workflow` orchestrator ending while a lane agent sat inside `pr-land` waiting on
 * required checks, so `gh pr create` never ran. That work is invisible to the labelled-PR sweep above AND to
 * `/drain` (which only lands what's already labelled). `discover` additionally enumerates every remote
 * `lane/*` ref per repo (local git for the cwd repo, the SAME sibling clone `../frontierui`/`../plateau-app`
 * the drain's rebase-drop plumbing already depends on for a remote one, #2263 — a repo with no sibling clone
 * provisioned is simply skipped for this bucket, fail-soft) and buckets a ref `pr-missing` when it has NO PR
 * in ANY state (open, merged, OR a deliberately-closed one — a human closing a PR is a decision, never
 * silently overridden), its tip is NOT already an ancestor of `origin/main` (nothing landed already), it
 * carries a real non-manifest delivery (any file besides `.lane-manifest.json` changed against main — an
 * empty/aborted lane is not a finished delivery), and its tip commit is within `--window-days` of now (default
 * 7 — an ancient orphan reads as abandoned, not mid-flight, and `/finish` never resurrects one silently). The
 * item it delivers, when derivable, comes from the lane manifest first, then a `resolve #NNN` commit subject,
 * then a changed `backlog/NNN-*.md` file's own id. `open <laneRef>` then opens the PR for exactly one such ref
 * through the SAME transport every lane uses — `scripts/pr-land.mjs --label-on-green` (never a raw
 * `gh pr create`) — refusing when a PR already exists for that head (any state), the tip is already on main,
 * or the card it resolves is already `status: resolved` on main by a DIFFERENT commit (a human/finisher must
 * reconcile which delivery is real first).
 *
 * LAND (#2202, #2290) — the durable, tested version of the 2026-07-03 scratchpad plumbing. Reuses the ONE #2198
 * rebase-drop-manifest helper (`scripts/lib/rebase-drop-manifest.mjs`, shared with the label lander): for a PR
 * whose required `test` is green but which is only CONFLICTING/BEHIND, it rebuilds the tip onto main (manifest
 * dropped) via pure plumbing — no branch checkout. #2290: lane-resume NO LONGER merges directly — the drain is
 * the sole writer to main. Instead it ENQUEUES (ensures the `ready-to-merge` label) and TRIGGERS a single-couple
 * drain pass (`merge-ai-prs.mjs --only=<pr>`) that lands the recovered lane through the shared gate. A red `test`
 * (a real bug) or a real (non-manifest) conflict is NOT enqueued — the finisher repairs code first. `UNSTABLE` +
 * `test=pass` IS mergeable (only `test` is required; `cla`/Workers-Builds are non-required). So `/finish` =
 * discover-then-repair-then-`land` (enqueue + trigger the drain, which shares the same helper).
 *
 * Guard-safe: read-only `discover` (git show / gh list); `land` only pushes to a `lane/*` ref (the #1934
 * carve-out) + labels/triggers the drain — never a branch checkout, never a direct `gh pr merge` (any such
 * merge would be rejected by `scripts/lib/pr-merge-gate.mjs`). Fails soft — a PR whose manifest can't be read is
 * reported as `unknown`, never crashes the plan.
