 * The item-pull half of land-advance's pure plan (#3720), import-free so the read-only declaring module stays so.
 * The queue itself is read in `land-advance-items-io.mjs` (`priorityQueue`). Every hold (blockedBy, epics, no
 * `scope:`, scope overlap, free lanes, the pause) is dispatch-plan's rule: `planItems` only takes its launches up to
 * the budget land-advance has left, and never re-derives a hold.
