/**
 * @file scripts/operations/gate-health.mjs
 * @description THE `gate-health` DECLARATION — can the merge history answer *"are the review-escalation
 *   criteria selecting the right PRs?"*, and if not, what is blocking it?
 *
 * An OPERATION rather than a script because the question is asked repeatedly, and because the same arithmetic
 * decides whether an A/B variant beat its control. Both steps are `compute`, so `./http-adapter.mjs` derives
 * a `GET`-only surface with no run records — the path `suggest-next` already exercises.
 *
 * Its import graph holds no `node:` specifier and cannot reach `./gate-health-io.mjs`, so the step functions
 * have no writer in scope. `gh` and `git` live in the io module and only read.
 *
 * The statistics are `../lib/gate-health.mjs`. Arithmetic in THIS file is a bug.
