/**
 * @file scripts/operations/file-item.mjs
 * @description THE `file-item` DECLARATION — file a new backlog card AND clear it for the conveyor to pull,
 *   as one callable unit (epic #3383's own machinery, "every new backlog item files through the mechanical
 *   conveyor"). Graduated to `main` from `origin/lane/mechanical-dispatcher` per #3548.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. `we:scripts/operations/scaffold.mjs` already declares the BIRTH of a card, and #3383's own
 * mechanical-delivery-doctrine rule 2 ("mechanical dispatch runs on the card + the generic brief, never a
 * bespoke prompt") already governs BUILD dispatch. Filing was the gap: found live 2026-09-06, when a session
 * driving this epic realized every single item it had filed that session went through a hand-dispatched
 * `Agent`-tool subagent with a bespoke prompt — never through a declared operation, because none covered the
 * FULL filing sequence. `scaffold` alone is not that sequence: it writes the card and stops. A filed item that
 * is never cleared for the conveyor (`we:scripts/conveyor/queue.mjs add`) sits invisible to `planTick` —
 * `we:scripts/conveyor/tick-core.mjs#planTick` builds its five launch lists from `state.queue`'s CLEARED
 * (`buildQueued`) rows ONLY, so an uncleared item, however ready, is never in `decisions.spawnBuilds`. A
 * session that files a card and stops has handed the mechanism nothing to pick up — the exact hand-off gap
 * this operation closes.
 *
 * IT RE-DERIVES NOTHING FROM `scaffold`. The `read` and `plan` steps below call `shapeScaffoldRead` /
 * `planScaffold` (`./scaffold.mjs`) DIRECTLY — same reader shape, same allocator, same refusals
 * (`SCAFFOLD_REFUSALS`), same rendered content. This operation adds exactly one thing scaffold does not do:
 * decide whether the freshly-born card should be cleared for the conveyor, and declare that clearance as a
 * second effect beside the write. A caller who wants scaffold's behaviour with no clearance still has
 * `scaffold` itself — this is not a replacement for it, it is the fuller sequence.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL, DELIBERATELY, NOT HERE:
 *   - COMPOSING THE CONTENT (title/digest/scope/sizing) inherently needs judgment — an LLM reading the
 *     situation and writing prose. That step cannot be a `compute`/`effect`/`judge`/`confirm` (none of the
 *     four kinds performs open-ended authorship), so it is not removed, only routed correctly: the calling
 *     agent composes the text and passes it as ordinary string inputs, exactly as it already does for
 *     `scaffold` today. This operation starts from "the text already exists."
 *   - LANDING (commit / `verify` / `open-pr`) is NOT folded in here. Those are already declared operations
 *     (`we:scripts/operations/verify.mjs`, `we:scripts/operations/open-pr.mjs`) that apply to every
 *     constellation-repo change, not just a filed card — folding them in would duplicate machinery this file's
 *     own header warns against re-deriving. The skill that owns this operation
 *     (`we:skills-src/file-item/SKILL.md`) states the three-call sequence: `file-item`, then `verify`, then
 *     `open-pr`.
 *   - AN IMMEDIATE DISPATCH ATTEMPT. A freshly-filed item almost never passes `planTick`'s own readiness gate
 *     the instant it is born (unsized epics/decisions can never build at all; a story usually still needs a
 *     lane scope decided and any `blockedBy` cleared) — so a same-call dispatch attempt would be a no-op in
 *     the overwhelming majority of real filings, for the cost of importing the conveyor's live tick machinery
 *     into a operation whose job is to WRITE A CARD. Clearing it via `queueAdd` is what removes the
 *     "wait for a human to remember `queue.mjs add`" step; the next tick's `planTick` still owns the READINESS
 *     decision, exactly as it does for every other cleared item. If a caller genuinely knows an item is
 *     build-ready the instant it is filed, `we:scripts/operations/dispatch-lane.mjs` is the separate declared
 *     call to make next — this operation does not reach into it.
 *
 * QUEUE-AD EFFECT REUSES `we:scripts/conveyor/queue-store.mjs`'s PURE CORE (`addToQueue`) rather than
 * shelling `queue.mjs` — same reason `dispatch-lane.mjs` "reaches nothing" in its own static import graph:
 * the io shell (`./file-item-io.mjs`) is the only place this touches `fs`.
 *
 * NON-DISPATCHABLE KINDS ARE DUPLICATED HERE, NOT IMPORTED, and that is a deliberate, narrow choice, not an
 * oversight: `we:scripts/conveyor/queue.mjs`'s own `NON_DISPATCHABLE` map is module-local (not exported), and
 * exporting it would touch a file under active concurrent work (#3478's queue-sidecar-resolution PRs) for a
 * two-line gain. The two kinds it names — `epic` (needs `/slice`) and `decision` (needs `/prepare` +
 * `/decision`) — are read from `we:scripts/check-standards-rules.mjs#BACKLOG_KINDS`'s own closed set, so this
 * file cannot invent a THIRD kind queue.mjs does not also know about; the two lists are asserted to agree in
 * `./__tests__/file-item.test.mjs`.
 *
 * PURE. No fs, no clock, no process, no network. `./file-item-io.mjs` is the only place it touches the world.
