/**
 * @file scripts/operations/telemetry-store.mjs
 * @description THE THIN IO SHELL over {@link ./telemetry.mjs} (#3383) — where a delivery span/metric lands on
 * disk, and the never-throwing RECORDER handle every dispatch wrapper and the runner tick loop call.
 *
 * The pure core — what an event IS, how it validates, serializes, parses, and rolls up into the four golden
 * signals — lives next door and is re-exported here so a caller has ONE import. Same split as
 * `call-log.mjs`/`call-log-store.mjs` and `run-record.mjs`/`run-store.mjs`.
 *
 * ================================================================================================
 * WHERE IT LIVES, AND WHY THAT SHAPE — `we:.operations/telemetry/<YYYY-MM-DD>.jsonl`
 *
 * A gitignored, DAY-ROTATED, append-only NDJSON sidecar, resolved by SCRIPT LOCATION (never CWD) with an
 * `OPERATION_TELEMETRY_DIR` override — mirroring `call-log-store.mjs` exactly, which is the repo's one
 * existing append-only store. Three properties decided it over the alternatives, each of which is a real
 * store already in this directory:
 *
 *   1. ONE FILE PER RUN (the `run-store.mjs` / `completion-store.mjs` shape: temp-write + rename, one JSON
 *      document per key) was rejected because a span is not a document. A single delivery emits 8–12 spans
 *      from ONE process; a document store would either need 12 files or a read-modify-write of one file per
 *      span, and read-modify-write is precisely what breaks when N dispatched lanes run at once.
 *   2. APPEND-ONLY NDJSON IS CONCURRENCY-SAFE WITHOUT A LOCK. Every writer opens `O_APPEND` and writes ONE
 *      line; POSIX guarantees an append of at most `PIPE_BUF` (4096 bytes on macOS and Linux) is atomic, so
 *      lines from concurrent lanes interleave as whole lines and never corrupt each other. This is the
 *      reason `telemetry.mjs#MAX_LINE_BYTES` is 3800 rather than "large enough" — the bound is not a style
 *      preference, it is what makes the lock-free concurrency claim true. Nothing here takes a lock,
 *      which also means a telemetry write can never deadlock a delivery.
 *   3. DAY ROTATION MAKES THE ROLLING-WINDOW QUERY CHEAP. The rolling-24h capacity view
 *      (`we:backlog/3569-*`) reads at most TWO files regardless of how long the system has been running, and
 *      a retention sweep is `rm` of old days rather than a compaction pass.
 *
 * A SECOND STREAM WAS NOT MINTED. `.operations/calls/<day>.jsonl` (`call-log-store.mjs`) is the ACCESS log —
 * "operation X was called" — with four fields, no duration, no correlation id, and explicitly nothing
 * resumable. This is the TRACE log. Folding spans into the call log would break its own stated contract (a
 * line there is a single instant), and folding the call log into this one would put a `compute`-only
 * page-load read in the same stream as a 40-minute delivery. They are siblings on purpose.
 * ================================================================================================
 *
 * THE PURITY DISCIPLINE — THE LOAD-BEARING PROPERTY OF THIS FILE.
 *
 * This code runs INSIDE the critical path of every real delivery. The same rule the driver watchdog is held
 * to applies with full force: **a telemetry bug must never be able to break a delivery.** Concretely:
 *
 *   • NOTHING IN THE RECORDER THROWS. Every public method of {@link createTelemetryRecorder}'s handle is
 *     wrapped; a failure returns `{ok: false, error}` and is counted on the handle's own `errors` counter,
 *     never propagated. A caller may ignore the return value entirely, and every call site does.
 *   • NO SUBPROCESS, NO NETWORK, NO LOCK, NO TIMER, NO ASYNC. One `appendFileSync` of one bounded line. There
 *     is no exporter to flush, so there is nothing to lose at exit and nothing to shut down — which is why a
 *     `SIGKILL`ed process loses at most the span it was inside, and why {@link DURABLE_SPAN_NAMES} exists to
 *     make even that visible.
 *   • FAIL-OPEN ON READ, unlike `run-store.mjs`. A torn last line (a process killed mid-append) yields
 *     `corrupt: 1` and the remaining events, never a throw — nothing is ever RESUMED from this log, so the
 *     fail-closed reasoning that protects run records ("a torn record must not read as never-happened") does
 *     not apply and would only turn an observability file into an outage.
 *   • KILLABLE BY ENV. `WE_TELEMETRY=0` yields a recorder whose methods are no-ops with the identical shape,
 *     so disabling it changes nothing about call-site control flow.

 * rule (#2747), so it is justified rather than assumed. That rule governs a date-only stamp a HUMAN reads as
 * a calendar day: `dateOpened` on a backlog card, a report's filename. This is neither. It is a STORAGE

 *   2. The rolling-window read (`telemetry-cli.mjs#daysInWindow`) derives candidate day keys by UTC
 *      arithmetic on the event instants themselves; a locally-keyed filename would not line up with it, and a
 *      DST transition would silently drop or duplicate an hour of events.
 *
 * This is exactly the "UTC-anchored arithmetic rather than a wall-clock read" case the scan's own exemption
 * names. `call-log-store.mjs#dayKey` — the sibling append-only store — makes the same choice.
 *
 * utc-day-slice-ok: a machine log's storage partition key, not an operator-facing calendar date; must be

// ── AMBIENT CONTEXT — how a SHARED helper emits a span without every caller plumbing a recorder ───────

/**
 * THE AMBIENT ACTIVE RECORDER, and the argument for it.
 *
 * `minimal-context-provider.mjs#acquireLane` is imported by all SIX dispatch wrappers, and
 * `#runVerifyOperation` by three. Instrumenting those two functions once buys `lane.acquire` and
 * `verify.gate` spans across every dispatch kind, with no per-wrapper edit — which is exactly the "find the
 * seam, don't bolt on six parallel systems" requirement. But they take no recorder, and threading one through
 * every call site of a 6/6 shared helper (and through every existing test that calls it) is a large, risky
 * diff for a purely observational feature.
 *
 * So this module keeps ONE module-level active recorder, set by whichever wrapper is driving, exactly the way
 * OpenTelemetry's own API keeps an implicit ACTIVE CONTEXT rather than demanding a tracer parameter on every
 * function. The usual objection to ambient state — that concurrent work interleaves and one task reads
 * another's context — DOES NOT APPLY HERE, and the reason is structural rather than hopeful:
 *
 *   • ONE PROCESS PER DISPATCH. Concurrent deliveries are separate OS processes (`dispatch-lane-io.mjs`
 *     spawns each provider detached, with its own `pid:<n>` handle), not concurrent tasks in one process.
 *     Two dispatches can never share this module instance.
 *   • The wrappers are straight-line code. `deliverItem` and friends `await` exactly one thing at a time;
 *     there is no `Promise.all` over two instrumented phases anywhere in the six.
 *
 * If either of those ever stops being true, the fix is `AsyncLocalStorage` — a drop-in replacement for the
 * two accessors below and nothing else. Named here so the next reader does not have to re-derive it.
 *
 * A wrapper that forgets to set it loses nothing but the two shared spans: {@link activeRecorder} returns the
 * NULL recorder when unset, so an uninstrumented caller behaves exactly as it does today.

 *      real disk. Without this the wrapper would unconditionally mint a file-backed recorder and a test could
 *      only assert on the filesystem, which is precisely the kind of untestable seam that lets wiring rot
 *      unnoticed. The alternative — a `telemetry` parameter on all six wrapper signatures — is a much larger
 *      diff through code that is not otherwise being changed, and six more things to keep in step.

//
// `hostMetrics`/`readHostSample` (the earlier #3383 landing) only ever answer "is the HOST loaded" — never
// "how much of THIS ONE dispatch's cost was CPU". This is the per-span half: sample `process.cpuUsage()`
// immediately before and after the wrapped call, and merge the delta into the span's own `ok`/`fail`
// attributes, so `agent.turn` (and any other span a caller wraps this way) carries a real resource-cost number
// next to its wall-clock duration, not just the duration alone.
//
// #3383 MECHANICAL-DISPATCHER FOLLOW-UP — THE SPAWN SIDE WAS FIXED; THE CPU NUMBER ITSELF WAS NOT, AND THAT IS
// AN HONEST FINDING, NOT A DEFERRAL. This section originally documented, correctly, that `process.cpuUsage()`
// measures the WRAPPER process, never the spawned agent, because every dispatch wrapper spawned its agent via
// the SYNCHRONOUS `execFileSync`/`spawnSync`. The follow-up brief assumed the fix was `ChildProcess
// #resourceUsage()` on the ASYNC `child_process.spawn()` API. THAT METHOD DOES NOT EXIST — verified against
// real Node v18.2.0 and v22.1.0 (`ChildProcess.prototype` has no such member, for a plain `spawn()` OR a
// `fork()`) and against `@types/node`'s own `child_process.d.ts` (silent on it) versus `process.d.ts` (which
// DOES declare `resourceUsage()`, but on `process` — the CURRENT process — never a child). See
// `scripts/lib/spawn-to-completion.mjs`'s own header for the full verification trail.
//
// What DID land: every wrapper's full-turn agent spawn now goes through `scripts/lib/spawn-to-completion.mjs
// #spawnToCompletion` (via `dispatch-lane-io.mjs#spawnAgentToCompletion` / `codex-delivery-provider.mjs
// #defaultSpawnCodexAgent`) — a real, tested improvement (async, streaming, non-blocking-event-loop, the exact
// `execFileSync` contract preserved) — but it does not, and cannot, supply a real per-child rusage reading on
// today's Node. `recordChildResourceUsage`/`takeChildResourceUsage` below are kept anyway, as the narrow,
// ambient side-channel (mirroring this file's own `setActiveRecorder`/`activeRecorder` pattern) a provider's
// `spawn()` would use to hand a real reading up to the `agent.turn` span IF one were ever available — a
// forward-compatible no-op today, never a fabricated number. `resolveTurnCpuAttributes` reflects this honestly:
// it prefers a real child reading when one exists (`cpuSource: 'child'`), and otherwise falls back to the
// ORIGINAL wrapper-only `process.cpuUsage()` delta (`cpuSource: 'wrapper'`) — which, in practice, is what every
// `agent.turn` span reports today. The genuinely reliable per-agent-cost signal remains what the prior #3383
// landing already built for exactly this reason: `host-process-sample.mjs`'s external, `ps`-based sampling of
// the live dispatched child from OUTSIDE the wrapper process.
