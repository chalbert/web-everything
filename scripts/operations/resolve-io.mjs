/**
 * @file scripts/operations/resolve-io.mjs
 * @description THE IO SHELL of the `resolve` declaration (#xrrpfo7) — the reader its `read` step is injected
 *   with, and the sink its `write` effect is applied through.
 *
 * SAME SPLIT AS `./claim-io.mjs`, deliberately: `./resolve.mjs` is the WHAT and this is the only place it
 * touches the world, which is what lets every refusal in the declaration be tested with no filesystem and no
 * git.
 *
 * IT REUSES, IT DOES NOT RESTATE. `resolveBacklogFile`/`idFromName`/`readField` come from the same modules
 * `claim-io.mjs` uses; the write goes through the extracted guarded writer
 * (`we:scripts/backlog/guarded-write.mjs#writeBacklogMd`) and never a bare `writeFileSync`, because that
 * writer owns the lane-not-primary refusal and the #883 locus scan at write time. A second writer here would
 * be a second answer to "may this file be written", which is the failure #2644 names.
 *
 * THE SCOPE READ IS THE EXPENSIVE ONE, and it is deliberately shaped to report THREE states rather than two.
 * `reconcileScope` can only run when the item declares a `scope:`; a pre-#2613 legacy item declares none, and
 * the CLI prints a note and passes. So this reader returns `scopeDeclared` SEPARATELY from `offending`:
 * `{scopeDeclared: false}` means the check could not run, `{scopeDeclared: true, offending: []}` means it ran
 * and found nothing. `planResolve` keeps them apart for the same reason `verify` keeps `unrun` out of `pass`.
 *
 * IMPURE by construction: `fs`, `git`.

 * `scopeDeclared: true` with an empty `offending`, which `planResolve` reads as "ran and found nothing".
 * The declaration's whole three-state design exists to keep "could not check" apart from "checked clean",
