 * @file scripts/operations/minimal-context-provider.mjs
 * @description THE SHARED PRIMITIVES behind every minimal-context dispatch mechanism — extracted from
 * `we:scripts/operations/deliver-item-wrapper.mjs` (#3627, PR #2107, live-tested end to end against real item
 * #3371) once a SECOND dispatch kind needed the same proven shape (#xu2pp2m, downstream of #3627/#3628).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, PER THE OPERATOR'S OWN RULING (recorded on `we:backlog/xu2pp2m-*.md`): the reviewer
 * mechanism (`we:scripts/operations/review-dispatch-wrapper.mjs`) and the fixer mechanism (not built yet — out
 * of scope for the item that created this file) are TWO SEPARATE PRIMITIVES, never one monolithic file and
 * never literal duplication. The parts of `deliver-item-wrapper.mjs`'s pattern that are genuinely NOT
 * delivery-specific — the `CLAUDE_RESTRICTED_PROVIDER` argv shape, the trimmed-hooks-settings-file generation,
 * lane acquire/release, and the "run one declared operation, read its structured verdict" gate-running pattern
 * — live HERE, so both mechanisms import the same proven code instead of each re-deriving or copy-pasting it.
 *
 * HONESTY LABEL, SAME CONVENTION `deliver-item-wrapper.mjs` USES. Every export below is a VERBATIM or
 * mechanically-generalized (parameterized, never behaviourally changed) lift of code that was already proven
 * live against real item #3371 — see that file's own header for the verification trail (the `--restricted`
 * vs `--bare` vs `--safe-mode` evidence in particular). Nothing here is a fresh, unverified design; the only
 * new code is the PARAMETERIZATION itself (a `purpose`/`fileName`/`dirName` argument in place of a hardcoded
 * delivery-specific literal), which is mechanical and covered by this file's own tests plus
 * `deliver-item-wrapper.test.mjs`'s pre-existing ~106 tests (unchanged, still passing — see that file's own
 * import list, which now resolves several of its names through this module instead of a local definition).
 *
 * PARK-UNTIL-EXERCISED APPLIES TO THE CONSUMERS, NOT TO A RE-EXTRACTION OF ALREADY-PROVEN CODE. This module
 * itself changes no runtime behaviour for `deliver-item-wrapper.mjs` (an extraction, not a rewrite — its own
 * test suite is the proof); `we:docs/agent/prototype-based-dev.md`'s "park until genuinely exercised" rule
 * applies to the NEW consumer (`review-dispatch-wrapper.mjs`), which is unwired and unexercised, exactly as
 * `deliver-item-wrapper.mjs` itself was before its own live test.
 *
 * IMPURE: `node:child_process`, `node:fs`. Every impure call takes an injectable `run`/`spawnAgent` (mirrors
 * `deliver-item-wrapper.mjs`'s own convention) so every export here is unit-testable with no real subprocess.

 * THE BUG THIS CLOSES (#xu2pp2m, live run against real PR #2108 from an isolated scratch clone, driver-

 * git rev-parse --show-toplevel` against whatever cwd it is spawned with, then `POOL_ROOT = <that checkout's
 * workspace>/.lanes` — see `scripts/lib/lane-pool-paths.mjs#defaultPoolRoot`). Handing it `REPO_ROOT` when
 * this module's own file happens to sit in a throwaway scratch clone that was never provisioned with its own
 * sibling `.lanes` pool makes it look for lanes in a directory that was never provisioned — exact repro: `✗ no
 * lanes provisioned for "web-everything" under <scratch-clone-parent>/.lanes ... run provision --count=N
 * first`. Resolving from `processCwd` instead — the SAME source `lane-pool.mjs` itself trusts for its own
 * `CHECKOUT_ROOT` — fixes it: an operator/orchestrator whose OWN working checkout is the real, provisioned
 * one gets the pool `lane-pool.mjs` would resolve if invoked directly, even while the wrapper's `.mjs` file
 * itself lives elsewhere. Matches `docs/agent/prototype-based-dev.md`'s Portability note and the

/**
 * REAL. Acquires a lane via `lane-pool.mjs acquire --adopt`, stamping the ACQUIRING subprocess's own
 * `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` to `claudeSessionId` — never left to inherit whatever the CALLING wrapper process's
 * own env carries — so `--adopt` records the eventual occupant's real identity (`guard-lane.mjs` later compares
 * against exactly this). Then best-effort clears any STALE `.git/.lane-verify` marker a prior occupant left
 * behind via `verify-lane.mjs reset` (`resetStaleVerifyMarker`) — see that function's own docblock.
 *
 * TWO REAL SHAPES, BOTH VERIFIED, SELECTED BY WHETHER `lane` IS GIVEN:
 *   - NUMBERED (the ORIGINAL `deliver-item-wrapper.mjs` shape, byte-for-byte unchanged — argv order is a real
 *     contract several tests pin exactly): a tick plan hands this a specific lane NUMBER
 *     (`--lane=<N> --purpose=<p> --session=<slug> --scope=<s> --item=<i> --adopt`), and the real path is
 *     re-resolved afterward via `resolveLanePath` (a fresh, authoritative read) — this branch returns nothing,
 *     matching its pre-extraction behaviour (every existing caller discards the return value).
 *   - UNNUMBERED (`we:skills-src/review/review-agent-brief.md` step 1's own real, already-proven shape:
 *     `--purpose=<p> --session=<slug> [--wait-ms=<n>] --adopt`, no `--lane=`/`--scope=`/`--item=` at all) —
 *     lets `lane-pool.mjs` pick any free lane. VERIFIED against the real CLI while building this extraction:
 *     `lane-pool.mjs acquire`'s own stdout is JUST the acquired lane's absolute path (every informational line —
 *     "acquired lane-N for...", the holder slug, the release command — goes to STDERR, confirmed by a real
 *     `1>file 2>file` redirect), so this branch reads that stdout directly as the lane path and RETURNS it —
 *     there is no lane number to re-resolve a path from afterward.
 *
 * @param {{lane?: (number|string), sessionSlug: string, scope?: string, item?: (string|number), claudeSessionId: string, purpose?: string, waitMs?: number, base?: string}} o
 *   `purpose` defaults to `'conveyor-delivery'` — the delivery wrapper's own pre-existing behaviour, unchanged.
 *   `lane` omitted (undefined/null) selects the UNNUMBERED shape; `waitMs` (only meaningful there) adds
 *   `--wait-ms=<n>`, matching the review brief's own `--wait-ms=30000` self-healing-momentary-capacity-flicker
 *   reasoning (see that brief's step 1 for the full account). `base` (only meaningful there too, #xu2pp2m
 *   fixer) adds `--base=<ref>`, landing the acquired clone on a predecessor lane's pushed tip (a `lane/*` ref)
 *   instead of `origin/main` — see the UNNUMBERED branch's own comment below for why a fixer needs this.
 * @param {{run?: Function}} [io]
 * @returns {string|undefined} the acquired lane's real path for the UNNUMBERED shape; `undefined` for the
 *   NUMBERED shape (unchanged — callers there already re-resolve via `resolveLanePath`).
