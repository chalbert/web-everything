 * @file scripts/operations/review-loop-cli.mjs
 * @description #3072's REMAINING SLICE, MADE CALLABLE — drives ONE `review-pr` run unattended, using
 * `we:scripts/lib/review-loop-policy.mjs`'s ratified confirm policy, and files a notification either way the
 * policy leaves a debt behind: the queued-accept notice when it DECLINES an accept (`review:human`), or the
 * filed-prevention notice when it ANSWERS accept over an unfiled prevention guard (#3442, `review:pending`).
 *
 *   node scripts/operations/review-loop-cli.mjs --pr=1234 --repo=chalbert/web-everything --cwd=<a lane>
 *   node scripts/operations/review-loop-cli.mjs --resume=<run-id> --repo=chalbert/web-everything --pr=1234
 *
 * WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE ENTRY POINT FROM `run.mjs review-pr`, NOT A FLAG ON IT. `runOperationCli`
 * (`we:scripts/operations/cli-adapter.mjs`) drives every declared operation for a HUMAN at a terminal — it
 * calls `driveRun` with `attemptedBy: 'human'` and no `autoConfirm`, which is exactly right for that caller.
 * Threading an `--unattended` flag through the GENERIC adapter would let every OTHER declared operation opt
 * into a review-specific policy it knows nothing about — the same "a declaration's own concern leaking into
 * the shared adapter" shape `review-pr.mjs` itself refuses at its `read` step (`assertMandatoryLensSeated`
 * lives on the declaration, not on `cli-adapter.mjs`). So this operation's unattended path gets its own thin
 * entry point, the same way `we:scripts/operations/dispatch-abort.mjs` is its own plain module rather than a
 * mode of `run.mjs`.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE OWNS, AND ONLY THIS: wiring `driveRun`'s generic `autoConfirm` seam to the CONCRETE policy,
 * and — the one genuinely new behaviour — filing the queued-accept notification when that policy declines an
 * accept. Everything else is reused, not re-derived: `run.mjs`'s own operation table (`resolveOperation`,
 * `createCliJudgeFactory`) builds the exact same declaration/registry/sinks/judge the human CLI uses, and
 * `we:scripts/operations/cli-adapter.mjs`'s own `parseOperationArgv` / `renderOutcome` / `restartCommand`
 * render every stop this shares with the human path — so a bug fixed in either place is fixed here too, and
 * the two callers can never quietly drift on what a stop MEANS.
 *
 * THE ROUND CAP NEEDS NOTHING NEW HERE (see `review-loop-policy.mjs`'s header for the full account): by the
 * time this file sees a run, `run.verdict.loop` is already `converged` / `in-progress` / `exhausted` /
 * `escalated`, computed by `deriveLoopOutcome` off the verdict ledger's own history. `--json` already prints
 * it (`outcomePayload`'s `verdict` field IS the whole `reduce` finding). This file's plain-text output names
 * it explicitly anyway, so a human skimming stdout for "did this bounce cleanly or run out of rounds" is not
 * forced to parse JSON to find out.
 *
 * ONE ROUND PER INVOCATION, DELIBERATELY. Re-judging the SAME diff twice in one process is not what the round
 * cap is FOR — round N+1 exists only once the diff has actually changed (a fix landed), which happens in a
 * different process entirely. So this script drives exactly one read→judge→judgeSecurity→reduce→confirm
 * [→record] pass and exits; the loop ACROSS rounds is realized by re-invoking it once the PR's diff moves —
 * `#3279`'s dispatched session's job every time it runs, never a `while` loop inside this file.
 *
 * IMPURE: spawns jurors (via the injected judge), writes run records, and — only on a queued accept — appends
 * one line to the learnings pool. Everything DECISION-shaped is imported from a pure module (`review-loop-
 * policy.mjs`); nothing here decides, it only wires and reports.
