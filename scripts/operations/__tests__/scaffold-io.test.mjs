/**
 * @file scaffold-io.test.mjs — the `scaffold` IO SHELL (#xrrpfo7).
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS AT ALL, stated plainly: its absence was flagged as a carve-out on PR #1511, and the
 * SAME absence one operation over produced PR #1510's blocker. There, `createResolveReader` shipped with its
 * reconciliation defaulting to `null` while `run.mjs` called it with no arguments — so a guard never ran, and
 * reported CLEAN while not running. Seventeen green tests missed it because every one drove the pure planner
 * with a hand-built fixture. A declaration suite cannot see a wiring bug, by construction.
 *
 * So these tests drive the REAL reader and the REAL sink with injected fs, never a fixture standing in for
 * them.
