/**
 * @file explore.test.mjs — the multi-agent committee investigation (#3150, under epic #3029).
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE IS FOR. #3150's acceptance has two clauses, and the tests are grouped to match them:
 *
 *   1. **Executable** — an `explore` operation in the OPERATIONS table with a derived CLI, and a run that
 *      dispatches a THREE-panelist committee against a fixture question, checks the synthesis step's findings
 *      shape, and captures each panelist's in-flight/resolved status on the run record through the SAME
 *      observer contract `dispatch-lane` uses. That is the `a real committee run, end to end` block below,
 *      which drives one run from `startRun` to `complete` with no `claude`, no `gh` and no filesystem.
 *   2. **Story-filing is a PARAMETERIZED effect** — the same declaration, the same run shape, one input
 *      different: a `report-only` run produces no backlog file and a `file-stories` run produces one through
 *      the existing scaffold CLI. Asserted as a PAIR in `the terminal effect is parameterized, not a fork`, so
 *      "parameterized" is proven by the two runs differing in nothing else.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE SPAWNS AN AGENT OR TOUCHES A CHECKOUT. Every sink and observer takes its io injected: the
 * `claude` argv is asserted exactly (it is the contract with the CLI), reports are served from a Map, and the
 * scaffold CLI is a spy. The one exception is `renderResearchTopic`, which is pure and asserted on its bytes.
