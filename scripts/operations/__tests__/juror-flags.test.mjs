/**
 * @file juror-flags.test.mjs — `--cwd` and `--model`, the JUROR flags of the derived command line (#3151).
 *
 * THE DEFECT THIS PINS. `review-pr`'s juror is TOOL-BEARING, and `assertLaneCwd` refuses to spawn one without a
 * lane of its own. That refusal is correct. What was not correct is that the ONLY way to supply the lane was
 * `JUDGE_LANE_CWD` in the environment: no `--help` output named it, the unknown-flag error listed only the
 * declared inputs, and so on 2026-08-17 at least three independent reviewers hit
 * `refusing to spawn a TOOL-BEARING juror` and each fell back to a fully manual review. A fourth found that
 * `--model=sonnet` — written into a dispatch prompt from memory — was not a flag at all.
 *
 * SO THE TESTS ARE THE TWO ROUND TRIPS A REVIEWER ACTUALLY MAKES:
 *
 *   1. **Error text → flag.** `--help` names the refusal verbatim enough to search for, and the unknown-flag
 *      message enumerates the control flags rather than only the declared inputs.
 *   2. **Flag → spawn.** A tool-bearing juror driven through `runOperationCli` with `--cwd=<a lane>` and
 *      **`JUDGE_LANE_CWD` deleted from the environment** reaches the spawn with that lane, and the REAL
 *      `assertLaneCwd` accepts it — the same run without the flag still refuses, which is what proves the flag
 *      is the thing supplying the lane and not an accident of the ambient environment.
 *
 * NOTHING HERE SPAWNS A JUROR. The `spawn` handed to `createDefaultJudge` is a stub that runs the real
 * `assertLaneCwd` over the options it was given and then returns a canned answer, so the guard under test is
 * the shipped one while the subprocess is not paid for. The one child process is `run.mjs --help`, whose whole
 * point is that the derived usage text reaches an operator through the real entry point.
