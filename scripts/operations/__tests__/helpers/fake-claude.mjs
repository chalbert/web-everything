/**
 * @file fake-claude.mjs — a REAL `claude` executable on `PATH` that costs nothing to run.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS, stated as the hole it closes. The sink's OWN docblock in
 * `we:scripts/operations/dispatch-lane-io.mjs` said it outright, and
 * `we:scripts/operations/__tests__/dispatch-lane-integration.test.mjs` repeated it as current fact:
 *
 *     *"NOT YET PROVEN LIVE. No test starts a `claude` process."*
 *
 * Both lines are rewritten by the same change that adds this file, because this file is what makes them false.
 *
 * Starting an agent is the ONE effect this whole delivery loop is built around, and nothing exercised it.
 * `buildAgentArgv` is pure and asserted, which pins the argv's SPELLING — but the same argument
 * `we:scripts/operations/__tests__/helpers/real-repo.mjs` makes about git applies here: asserting the argv
 * never says whether a CLI ACCEPTS it. That file's line is the general rule, and this is its second instance:
 *
 *     *"A STUB RETURNING `''` CANNOT HAVE CLONE GEOMETRY … asserting the argv only pins today's spelling,
 *      it never says whether the spelling WORKS."*
 *
 * The argv here has a specific reason to be doubted rather than assumed. `dispatch-lane-io.mjs`'s own
 * comment records that the prompt's position was decided WITHOUT a live check — *"untested against the real
 * CLI, and a wrong bet turns into a dispatch with a mangled prompt"* — and worked around by refusing a
 * leading dash. A shim that parses its argv the same way a real CLI would turns that bet into an assertion.
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS NOT. It does not run a model, spend a token, or prove an agent does useful work. It proves
 * the PLUMBING: that the argv parses, that `--bg` returns immediately rather than blocking, that the session
 * id the dispatcher pins is the id the observer later finds, and that a spawn failure surfaces as a failure.
 * The quality of what an agent produces is a different test and a different budget — this is the harness that
 * makes that test a swap of one binding rather than a new build.
 *
 * HOW IT WORKS. `withFakeClaude` writes an executable `claude` into a temp directory and hands back the
 * `PATH` prefix plus readers over what it recorded. Point `PATH` at it and the REAL
 * `defaultSpawnAgent`/`execFileSync` path runs unmodified — no injected spawner, no replaced production
 * path. That is deliberate, and it is the same reasoning `dispatch-lane-io.mjs` gives for separating `exec`
 * from `runNode`: overriding the high seam replaces the code under test, overriding the low one exercises it.

/**
 * Stand up a fake `claude` on disk.
 *
 * The returned surface is exactly what a consumer uses and no more. Two rounds of review were needed to make
 * that sentence true: the first cut also handed back `pathPrefix`, `dir` and `sessions()`; the cut that
 * removed them kept `calls()`, which nothing imported either — so the sentence certifying the dead surface
 * gone was itself an instance of the dead surface. `lastArgv` is the only reader anything uses.
 *
 * `assertWins` is the one member with no failure of its own in production use, and it is here on purpose:
 * this fixture exists to be extended, and a call that forgets `env` reaches the REAL `claude` on this
 * machine. For a `--bg` argv that means launching a real background agent, against a file whose headline
 * promise is that no model runs. Its refusal IS exercised — see the case that calls it without the override.
