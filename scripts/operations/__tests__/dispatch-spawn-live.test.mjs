/**
 * @file dispatch-spawn-live.test.mjs — the first test that STARTS A PROCESS to dispatch an agent.
 *
 * The sink's own docblock in `we:scripts/operations/dispatch-lane-io.mjs` said it, and
 * `./dispatch-lane-integration.test.mjs` repeated it as current fact: *"NOT YET PROVEN LIVE. No test starts a
 * `claude` process."* Everything about the one effect the delivery loop exists to perform was asserted against
 * stubs. Both of those lines are rewritten by the same change that adds this file — it is what makes them
 * false, so leaving them would leave the repo asserting the opposite of its own suite.
 *
 * WHAT A STUB COULD NOT ANSWER, and it is not the spelling of the argv — `buildAgentArgv` is pure, exported
 * and already asserted. It is whether a CLI ACCEPTS that spelling. `dispatch-lane-io.mjs`'s own comment
 * records the doubt: the prompt's position was reasoned about and never checked, *"untested against the real
 * CLI, and a wrong bet turns into a dispatch with a mangled prompt"*. A shim that parses argv the way a
 * commander-style CLI does converts that bet into an assertion.
 *
 * WHAT IT REMAINS HONEST ABOUT. The parser doing the accepting and the rejecting is a shim added alongside
 * these tests, so the fidelity claim is "modelled on a commander-style CLI", not "verified against the real
 * one". That is the same standing this repo already accepts for `real-repo.mjs`'s git geometry, and it is
 * strictly more than a stub returning a canned value could give. The real CLI stays unasserted until a live
 * run — which is a change of binding here, not a new harness.
 *
 * These tests run the REAL `defaultSpawnAgent` and the REAL `defaultListAgents` through the REAL
 * `execFileSync` with `PATH` pointed at the fake — no injected spawner. Overriding the high seam would replace
 * the code under test; this exercises it, the same reasoning the sink gives for separating `exec` from
 * `runNode`.
 *
 * COSTS NOTHING. No model runs, no token is spent.
