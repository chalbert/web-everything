/**
 * @file dispatch-spawn-live.test.mjs — the first test that STARTS A PROCESS to dispatch an agent.
 *
 * The sink's own docblock in `we:scripts/operations/dispatch-lane-io.mjs` said it, and
 * `./dispatch-lane-integration.test.mjs` repeated it as current fact: *"NOT YET PROVEN LIVE. No test starts a
 * `claude` process."* Everything about the one effect the delivery loop exists to perform was asserted against
 * stubs. Both of those lines are rewritten by the same change that adds this file — it is what makes them
 * false, so leaving them would leave the repo asserting the opposite of its own suite.
 *
 * WHAT A STUB COULD NOT ANSWER, and it is not the spelling of the argv — `buildAgentArgv` is pure, exported
 * and already asserted. It is whether a CLI ACCEPTS that spelling. `dispatch-lane-io.mjs`'s own comment
 * records the doubt: the prompt's position was reasoned about and never checked, *"untested against the real
 * CLI, and a wrong bet turns into a dispatch with a mangled prompt"*. A shim that parses argv the way a
 * commander-style CLI does converts that bet into an assertion.
 *
 * WHAT IT REMAINS HONEST ABOUT. The parser doing the accepting and the rejecting is a shim added alongside
 * these tests, so the fidelity claim is "modelled on a commander-style CLI", not "verified against the real
 * one". That is the same standing this repo already accepts for `real-repo.mjs`'s git geometry, and it is
 * strictly more than a stub returning a canned value could give. The real CLI stays unasserted until a live
 * run — which is a change of binding here, not a new harness.
 *
 * These tests run the REAL `defaultSpawnAgent` and the REAL `defaultListAgents` through the REAL
 * `execFileSync` with `PATH` pointed at the fake — no injected spawner. Overriding the high seam would replace
 * the code under test; this exercises it, the same reasoning the sink gives for separating `exec` from
 * `runNode`.
 *
 * COSTS NOTHING. No model runs, no token is spent.

 * Spawn through the REAL default path, with the fake first on PATH.
 *
 * `assertWins` runs FIRST, every time. It DOES fire: the last case in this file calls `spawnVia` with a
 * `PATH` that overrides `fake.env`, and the guard stops it before a process starts.
 *
 * That correction is the point. Round 3 added that case and left this docblock reading *"Every case here
 * passes `fake.env` today, so it never fires"* — which the same edit had just made false, since `extraEnv`
 * spreads AFTER `fake.env` below. The failure the guard prevents is live either way: a case that omits the
 * override reaches whatever `claude` the host has, and for a `--bg` argv on a machine with the real CLI
 * installed that is a real background agent launched by a test file whose headline promise is that no model
 * runs. Enforced rather than conventional.

  /**
   * RAISED from a 1_500ms session and a RATIO assertion (2026-08-29), after the ratio blew up under load
   * with no defect in the code it was testing. The property under test is "the foreground spawn pays
   * WORK_MS of real blocking; the background one does not" — not any particular absolute wall time, since
   * this file (like `wake-cli.test.mjs` before it) spawns real `node` child processes and machine
   * contention can inflate raw spawn/startup overhead in both calls. The PRIOR fix for that ("comparative,
   * not absolute" — `background < foreground / 2`) does not actually cancel that overhead out: it stays
   * inside both terms of the ratio. Once startup overhead (forking node, loading the shim, writing its log)
   * grew large enough under contention to rival WORK_MS itself, `foreground / 2` shrank towards `background`
   * and the assertion went red on a perfectly healthy run — the same shape of flake `execFileSync`'s own
   * `ETIMEDOUT` produced when a spawn simply took too long to start.
   *
   * SUBTRACTING the two elapsed times instead cancels the shared overhead exactly (both spawns pay ~the same
   * fork/startup cost), leaving only the one thing that differs between them: WORK_MS of real blocking on
   * the foreground side. The margin below only has to absorb scheduling jitter BETWEEN the two otherwise-
   * identical spawns, so it does not need to grow just because the machine is slower overall — and this file
   * is now routed to its own single `forks` process (vitest.config.ts) specifically to shrink that jitter.
