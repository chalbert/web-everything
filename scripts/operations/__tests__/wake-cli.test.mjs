/**
 * @file wake-cli.test.mjs — the waker's CLI block, which nothing used to execute (#3037, PR #1211 review F2).
 *
 * WHAT WAS UNTESTED, AND WHY IT IS THE SAME DEFECT CLASS AS AN UNREGISTERED OPERATION. `wake.mjs`'s
 * `if (IS_CLI)` block is the ONLY place the dispatch observer is wired in production. `wake.test.mjs` imports
 * the pure functions; `__fixtures__/observe-dispatch.mjs` builds its own observer table. So
 * `const observers = createDispatchObservers()` could be replaced with `{}` and all 163 test files stayed
 * green — an observer nothing reaches is the same shape of defect as a declaration nothing can resolve, which
 * `gate-health` shipped with once and which `dispatch-lane.test.mjs` now has a named test against.
 *
 * SO THIS DRIVES THE REAL CLI, in a real child process, and asserts what it OBSERVED WITH. Only `claude` is
 * stubbed — a two-line `sh` script on the child's `PATH` that records its argv and prints a canned listing.
 * That makes the child's `PATH` carry no real `claude`: **no agent is started and no `claude` process runs.**
 * Stubbing it that way also pins, across a real process boundary, that the listing is read as
 * `claude agents --json` and NEVER with `--all` (review F6) — with `--all` a finished build reads `running`
 * forever, which the observer's own docblock calls the one mistake that makes an observer worse than none.
 *
 * The third case drives `--resolve`, the close-out surface the review's F1 said did not exist: until it did,
 * an operator's only remedy for a dispatch the observer can never call `succeeded` was hand-written node,
 * once per completed build, forever.

 * to re-run instead of read, and this one's whole job is to prove a blocker fix.
 *
 * So the child sets the bound to `0`, which Node's `child_process` reads as NO TIMEOUT. That REMOVES the race

 * call already returned. Passed as `execFileSync`'s own `timeout` option, Node itself enforces this one: if the
 * child has not exited by the deadline, Node sends it `killSignal` (`SIGKILL`) and `execFileSync` throws.
 *
 * RAISED from 60s (2026-08-28), because "comfortably above every real case" stopped being true under a FULL
 * unsharded `npm run test:unit` run on a loaded machine: this genuinely healthy path (the stub `claude`/`gh` do
 * nothing but write a file and print — low-hundreds-of-ms on a quiet machine, per the wedged-kill test's own
 * comment below) was SIGKILLed by this exact 60_000ms bound three times in a row, with `stdout`/`stderr` empty —
 * proof the child was still starting up, not still working. `CHILD_PROCESS_TIMEOUT_MS` already carries the same
 * lesson once (its own history: this file's wall time went ~78s → ~512s, ~6.5x, under a sharded CI fork storm)
 * but that raise only widened the OUTER vitest bound — this INNER, Node-enforced kill never moved with it, so
 * under load it now fires FIRST and kills a slow-but-healthy child before the outer bound would even notice.
 * 100s keeps a real 20s margin below `CHILD_PROCESS_TIMEOUT_MS` (so the two still do not race — this one fires

// ── PR #1211 round-3 review, H4 — proving the ceiling is real, not merely trusted by inspection ───────────────

// Round three of this flake (CI run 31890521468, job 95025986829) falsified the previous fix's assertion in a
// THIRD, different way: the stub's marker file was PRESENT, meaning the run finished as if nothing had been
// killed. Chasing that as another timing/signal-delivery mystery (as rounds one and two each did) turned out to
// be the wrong move: local reproduction with debug instrumentation (timestamps + exit codes written by the stub
// itself, `TMPDIR`-scoped so no environment could interfere) found the REAL defect, on the FIRST local run —
// `sleep`, the command the stub used to simulate being wedged, is an EXTERNAL binary (`/bin/sleep` or
// equivalent), and this file deliberately restricts the child's `PATH` to a directory holding only the `claude`
// and `gh` stubs (`runWakeCli`'s `PATH: binDir`) — that restriction is BY DESIGN, the thing that guarantees no
// real `claude` is reachable. So `sleep N` inside the stub resolves to nothing: `sh` prints
// "sleep: command not found", exits that one statement 127, and the script falls straight through to the
// marker-file write — NOT after N seconds, but after however long the surrounding `node wake.mjs` process takes
// to start up and reach the call at all (irrelevant, low-hundreds-of-ms overhead on a quiet machine). The three
// rounds of "flakiness" were never a signal-delivery race: they were a coin flip between that overhead and
// whatever `execTimeoutMs` the assertion happened to be using that round — nothing here was ever proving a
// wedged child gets killed, on CI OR locally, and no amount of widening the OUTCOME margin (tried and verified
// to still fail — see git history) fixes a stub that was never actually blocking.
//
// THE FIX: stop depending on an external command to simulate "wedged". `while :; do :; done` is pure `sh`
// syntax (`:` is the shell no-op builtin) — it needs NOTHING on `PATH`, so it cannot silently no-op the way
// `sleep` did, and unlike `sleep N` it has NO natural completion to race against: the only way past it is a
// signal. That makes `stubRanToCompletion` a true proof of "was genuinely still wedged when killed" rather than
// a coin flip against unrelated startup overhead, and it means the margin below only has to absorb real
// scheduling/signal-delivery slack, not paper over a stub that finishes on its own.
