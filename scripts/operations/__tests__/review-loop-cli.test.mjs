/**
 * @file review-loop-cli.test.mjs — #3072's remaining slice, exercised end to end with no `gh`, no juror
 * subprocess and no real learnings-pool file: a stub `readPr`, a canned judge, recording sinks, an in-memory
 * run store and an injected `appendLearning`.
 *
 * THE FOUR PROPERTIES THIS FILE EXISTS TO PIN (#3434, 2026-09-01, reverses property 1's old shape — it used
 * to say "queues, never auto-accepts"; the operator's live-fire finding, two real PRs sitting queued for no
 * reason, is what prompted the reversal; property 4 added by #3442, finishing `#3434`'s second ratified item):
 *   1. A clean (or already-agreeing) verdict on a non-gate-self PR ACCEPTS MECHANICALLY — the effects apply,
 *      the run completes, and nothing is queued for a human (the old queue-and-notify path is now dead for
 *      this tier; the learnings-pool filing machinery it used stays for `review:human`'s own, unchanged, park).
 *   2. A verdict carrying findings BOUNCES unattended (`changes`, effects applied, run completes) — the round
 *      the operator's automated fix-loop already expects.
 *   3. A gate-self (`review:human`) PR is UNCHANGED: the policy declines (wrong actor), the run parks exactly
 *      as it does for the ordinary human CLI, and no accept — mechanical or manual — happens without one.
 *   4. A `prevention-outstanding` verdict on a non-gate-self PR ALSO accepts mechanically, exactly like
 *      property 1, but files the named guard(s) to the learnings pool as it clears — the notification a human
 *      still needs, without re-entering the bounce/retry loop over documentation debt the code itself doesn't
 *      have. The SAME verdict on a `review:human` PR still parks (property 3's actor refusal fires first).
