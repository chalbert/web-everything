/**
 * @file dispatch-crosses-processes.test.mjs — #3037's second acceptance clause, end to end.
 *
 * *"The launched agent's handle is recorded on the run so the conveyor can find it after a restart."* A
 * restart is a PROCESS boundary, so proving it needs one: the dispatch happens here, and every observation
 * happens in a **real second `node` process** that is handed nothing but a run id and a directory and
 * rehydrates everything else off disk — the same technique, and the same reason, as
 * `./run-crosses-processes.test.mjs`.
 *
 * The child runs the REAL observer (`we:scripts/operations/dispatch-lane-io.mjs`) against the REAL registry
 * resolved from the record's own operation name. Both of the observer's READS are stubbed through env vars —
 * the `claude agents --json` liveness listing and (since #x9ylkp7) the `gh pr list` PR listing. No `claude`
 * process is started by this suite, no agent is ever launched, and no network call is made.
