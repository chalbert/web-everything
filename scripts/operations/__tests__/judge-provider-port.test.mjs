/**
 * @file judge-provider-port.test.mjs — `createDefaultJudge` drives ANY `JudgeProvider`, not only `judgeSpawn`
 * (#3370, under #3369).
 *
 * THE FAKE HERE IS PORT-SHAPED, NOT CLI-SHAPED. Every existing judge fake in this repo (the `spawn` stub in
 * `juror-flags.test.mjs`, `fakeSpawn` in `we:scripts/lib/__tests__/judge-spawn.test.mjs`, `withFakeClaude`)
 * either stands in for `child_process.spawn` or for the `claude` binary itself — each still speaks in terms
 * of argv, stdout, or a mocked child process. This fake is neither: it is a hand-written plain async function
 * that receives the engine's `judge` request directly and returns the outcome shape `parseJudgeOutcome`
 * produces, with nothing CLI-shaped anywhere in it. That is the actual claim under test — that
 * `createDefaultJudge`'s `provider` option is a NAMED PORT a second implementation can satisfy (#3371),
 * not a slot that happens to accept whatever `judgeSpawn` looks like today.
