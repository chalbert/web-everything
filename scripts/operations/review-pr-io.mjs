/**
 * @file scripts/operations/review-pr-io.mjs
 * @description THE IO SHELL of the `review-pr` declaration (#3035, under epic #3029) — the reader its `read`
 *   step is injected with, and the sinks its `record` step's effects are applied through.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A SEPARATE FILE. {@link ./review-pr.mjs} is the DECLARATION: what the operation is. This is the
 * only place it touches the world, which is the same pure-core / io-shell split
 * {@link ./run-record.mjs} / {@link ./run-store.mjs} use, and it is what lets the declaration be unit-tested
 * with a stub reader and stub sinks — no `gh`, no `git`, no network.
 *
 * EVERY BINDING HERE SHELLS AN EXISTING SCRIPT. Nothing in this file decides anything about a review:
 *   - the park context is `we:scripts/review-detail.mjs#assembleReviewDetail`, the PURE assembler, fed by ONE
 *     PR view — by default ONE `gh pr view`, the same single call its own CLI makes. That one call is this
 *     operation's ONLY reach for the network, so it is the one binding with a swappable transport
 *     (`resolveViewReader`): a host that cannot authenticate `gh` stages the same JSON on disk instead. The
 *     diff is still taken from local git either way, so the transport cannot influence what is judged;
 *   - the diff and the changed-file list are `computeNetDiffText` / `computeNetDiffPaths`
 *     (`we:scripts/merge-ai-prs.mjs`, #2450/#2901) off ONE shared basis;
 *   - the label swap is `we:scripts/review-set-label.mjs`, the SINGLE HOME (#2644), shelled as a subprocess so
 *     it keeps its own `gh` arc, its `reviewed-sha`/`reviewed-diff`/`reviewed-contribution` markers, its
 *     independence check (#2844) and its #2964 write ordering. Re-implementing any of that here is the exact
 *     defect this slice is forbidden to introduce.
 *
 * IMPURE by construction: `gh`, `git`, `fs`.

 * The staged write-up's path — RUN-SCOPED, and that is the whole point.

 * the same checkout resolved to the SAME file: run B's write-up overwrote run A's staged bytes, and effect 1
 * then shelled the single home with `--body-file=` pointing at the wrong verdict. Interleaving the two runs'

 *
 * ORDINAL 0'S `idempotent: true` SURVIVES THIS, and the reason is that a replay is the SAME RUN. The effect
 * entry is created once and its payload frozen into the run record (`we:scripts/operations/engine.mjs`), and
 * `applyPendingEffects` re-applies the STORED entry with `ctx.runId = run.id` — the id of the record it is
 * resuming. So attempt N and attempt N+1 of one entry compute an identical path from an identical payload and
 * write identical bytes, which is exactly the property the declaration claims. Had the id been minted per
 * ATTEMPT rather than per run, this change would have broken it and would not be worth making.
 *
 * The id is validated with the SAME predicate the run store uses before putting it in a path, so a

    // sidecar at `.operations/review/verdicts.pending.jsonl` whose own result string said "NOT the #3007
    // verdict ledger". Its doc said the default would be "deleted rather than migrated" when the real writer
    // arrived. It is deleted here, and NOT migrated: those rows carry no write timestamp, no session id and no
    // head sha — the three fields that make a row a verdict RECORD rather than a payload echo — so importing
    // them would mean inventing the values the schema exists to attest. One row existed in the primary
    // checkout (PR #1146, 2026-08-09, accepted), and the label + comment it mirrors are still on that PR, which
    // is the durable record of it. The sidecar is session-local and gitignored, so there was never a complete
    // set to import in the first place.
    //
    // WHY THIS RECONCILES INSTEAD OF APPENDING. `we:scripts/review-set-label.mjs` is the SINGLE HOME of a label
    // swap and is now also the single home of a ledger row — effect 1 above shells it, so by the time this sink
    // runs the row already exists. Appending again here would put TWO rows in an append-only merge authority
    // for one verdict, which no dedupe can undo later. So this sink READS the ledger and reports the row effect
    // 1 wrote; it appends only when the ledger's LIVE verdict for the PR is not the one this round decided —
    // which means the single home's fail-soft write missed — and stamps that recovery row
    // `source: 'operation-reconcile'` so the ledger says which path produced it.
    //
    // WHAT COUNTS AS "ALREADY THERE" — THIS ROUND'S VERDICT, NOT ANY ROW AT ALL (PR #1149 review).
    // The first cut asked only whether the PR had a folded entry, and that is wrong in the ORDINARY
    // multi-round case, which is most PRs: a PR that got `changes` and later `accepted` has a `changes` row
    // from round 1, so when round 2's single-home append fail-softs the sink finds that stale row, reports
    // `{reconciled: true, verdict: 'changes'}`, and NEVER writes the acceptance. The ledger is then left
    // holding the superseded verdict while the label says accepted — the exact ledger/label disagreement this
    // whole item exists to detect, manufactured by the thing meant to prevent it. Reproduced by appending an
    // older `changes` row and calling this sink with `to: 'accepted'`.
    //
    // So the test is `folded.current.verdict === the verdict this payload implies`. The fold is latest-wins,
    // so `current` IS the ledger's live verdict for the PR; the question "did effect 1's write land?" is
    // exactly "does the live verdict already say what this round decided?". Both sides derive the verdict
    // through the ONE `verdictForLabelTarget` the writer uses, so they cannot disagree about what `to` means —
    // which is what makes the comparison sound rather than merely plausible.
    //
    // WHY NOT A CORRELATION ID FROM EFFECT 1, the exact alternative. It would distinguish rounds perfectly,
    // and its FAILURE MODE is the one thing that must never happen. The id has to survive being frozen into
    // the run record at suspend, cross a process boundary as a `review-set-label.mjs` argv flag, and land in a
    // new schema field; the moment any of those drops it, no row carries the id, the sink concludes the write
    // missed, and it APPENDS — a second row for one verdict in an append-only authority, which nothing can
    // undo. Verdict comparison fails the other way: its one ambiguity is a verdict that legitimately REPEATS
    // (a second `accepted` after a re-review), where the sink treats the earlier identical row as this
    // round's and writes nothing. That costs a duplicate history row saying what the ledger already says —
    // `current`, `clears` and `outstandingHolds` are all unchanged by its absence, so no consumer, present or
    // Phase-2, computes a different answer. An under-write of a redundant row against an unrecoverable
    // double-write of a real one is not a close call.
