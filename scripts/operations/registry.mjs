/**
 * @file scripts/operations/registry.mjs
 * @description THE DECLARATION SHAPE + THE REGISTRY of the operation engine (#3032, under epic #3029).
 *
 * ONE DECLARATION, DERIVED CALLERS. Per the statute
 * [#operations-declared-once-callers-generated](../../docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#operations-declared-once-callers-generated)
 * (#3031), a delivery-loop operation is declared once — input schema + ordered named steps — and every
 * caller is generated from it. This file owns the declaration and refuses a malformed one; the adapters
 * that read it are #3035 (command line) and #3036 (HTTP). **Nothing is declared onto this registry in this
 * slice** — #3032 is the machine, #3035 is the first declaration.
 *
 * THE SHAPE, LITERALLY `op(name, { input, ...steps })`:
 *
 * ```js
 * export const reviewPr = op('review-pr', {
 *   input:       { pr: 'number', aim: { type: 'string', required: false },
 *                  reason: { type: 'string', required: false, atConfirm: true } },
 *   verdictFrom: 'panel',                                   // optional: which step's finding IS the verdict
 *   diff:    compute({ reads: ['input.pr'],       fn: (v) => … }),
 *   panel:   judge({   reads: ['findings.diff'],  request: (v) => ({ mandate, input, shape }) }),
 *   humanOk: confirm({ reads: ['verdict'], asks: 'Accept this verdict?', of: 'operator',
 *                      options: ['accept', 'changes'] }),
 *   record:  effect({  reads: ['verdict', 'input.reason'],
 *                      effects: (v) => [{ type: 'ledger.append', payload: v }] }),
 * });
 * ```
 *
 * RETRACTED — this example used to show `reason: { type: 'string', required: false }`, an ORDINARY optional
 * input. That was wrong, and it was the shape PR #1569 shipped and PR #1572 had to undo: an ordinary input can
 * only ride the initial call, and a reason for overriding the juror is only knowable AFTER the juror returns.
 * The `atConfirm: true` marker above is what makes it suppliable at the moment it is decided — see
 * {@link normalizeInputSchema}.
 *
 * Step ORDER is the object's key order — JavaScript preserves insertion order for string keys, so the
 * declaration reads top-to-bottom as the run executes. `input` and `verdictFrom` are the ONLY reserved keys;
 * every other key is a step.
 *
 * REFUSED AT REGISTRATION, NEVER AT RUN TIME. A fifth kind, a hand-rolled step lookalike, a read of a
 * later step's finding, a read of an undeclared input field, a `verdictFrom` naming nothing — all of these
 * throw out of `op()`. The statute's *"a fifth kind is a signal to change the model"* is therefore a gate
 * a run can never reach, not advice in a comment.
 *
 * PURE. No fs, no clock, no process, no network. Leaf apart from {@link ./step-kinds.mjs}.

 *
 * THE SHAPE IS `<locus-prefixed path> [subcommand]`, and the subcommand is OPTIONAL because the two cases are
 * genuinely different. `we:scripts/verify-lane.mjs` has no subcommands, so naming the file names the whole
 * invocation. `we:scripts/backlog.mjs` has a dozen, and `claim` is declared over while `list` is not — a
 * file-granular claim there would condemn every `backlog.mjs` line in every skill, which is both wrong and
 * the fastest way to get a gate switched off.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FIELD IS FOR, and the line it draws. Only the AUTHOR knows which raw invocation an operation was
 * built to replace; nothing in the import graph says it. So that intent is DECLARED here — and nothing else
 * is. Whether the home actually reaches the operation is DERIVED from the import graph by the scan, never
 * restated as a flag on the declaration, because a restated fact goes stale the moment someone removes the
 * delegation and the declaration keeps insisting it is there. Declare what cannot be derived; derive the rest.
 *
 * A `command` of `null` means THE WHOLE FILE.

/**
 * Normalize an input schema — `{ pr: 'number' }` and `{ pr: { type: 'number', required: true } }` are the
 * same thing. Shorthand fields are REQUIRED; optionality is opt-in, so a caller cannot omit a field by
 * accident. Returns a frozen map of `{ type, required, default, enum }`.
 *
 * `enum` — A CLOSED SET, DECLARED ONCE. Under the statute's "declared once, callers generated", the set of
 * values a field accepts is part of what the operation IS, so declaring it buys three things from one line:
 * `validateInput` refuses anything outside it, the command line PRINTS it in `--help` instead of `<string>`,
 * and #3036's HTTP adapter gets the same for free. Before this, `review-pr` knew its four lenses (it re-exports
 * `PANEL_LENSES` from `we:scripts/lib/jury-core.mjs` expressly "so an adapter can list it in --help"), and the
 * adapter still printed `[--lens=<string>]` — the intent was there and the wiring was not, because the adapter
 * derives every flag from THIS schema and the schema had nowhere to put it. It generalises: any field with a
 * fixed vocabulary (a verdict target, a mode, a repo class) declares one here rather than validating by hand
 * inside its first step, where the refusal arrives after the run record already exists.
 *
 * Only `string` and `number` may carry one — a closed set of objects/arrays is a schema, not an enum, and
 * pretending otherwise would invite deep-equality membership tests the CLI's `--flag=value` parse cannot serve.
 *
 * `atConfirm` — WHEN THE FIELD IS SUPPLIED, not what it holds (#3035). An ordinary input field may ride exactly
 * one call: the one that STARTS the run. That is the right rule for everything that describes the SUBJECT (which
 * PR, which lens, which aim) — all of it is known before a step has run. It is the wrong rule for a value that
 * qualifies a DECISION, because the decision does not exist until the run has suspended and asked for it. The
 * field this marker was built for is `review-pr`'s `reason`: it says why an operator is overriding the juror, and
 * nobody can know an override is needed until `judge` has returned. Shipped as an ordinary input (PR #1569) the
 * flag was reachable ONLY before the fact it describes existed — `--resume` refuses input flags, correctly, since
 * the run record already holds them — so the guard that reads it could never be satisfied on the one path that
 * binds it.
 *
 * WHAT THE MARKER BUYS, and why it is here rather than in the adapter. The field stays a declared input, so a
 * step may name it in `reads` and `projectReads` will hand it over — that is the whole point, and it is exactly
 * what an adapter-only "control flag" could not give (the second bug PR #1572 fixed: the flag parsed, merged onto
 * the run record, and was then stripped by `projectReads` because the declaration did not name it). What changes
 * is WHEN it may be supplied: {@link validateInput} refuses it at start, and the CLI adapter accepts it only
 * alongside a `--answer`, merging it onto the run record there.
 *
 * It therefore cannot be `required` (nothing supplies it at the moment `required` is checked) and cannot carry a
 * `default` (a default is written at start, which would silently satisfy the very guard the field exists to feed
 * — a reasonless override wearing a canned reason). Both are refused below.
 *
 * @param {object|undefined} schema
 * @param {string} name - operation name, for error text.

/**
 * IS EVERY STEP OF THIS DECLARATION A `compute`? That is the whole test, and the name is the strongest thing
 * that can honestly be said about the answer.
 *
 * WHAT IS DERIVED FROM THE CLOSED VOCABULARY, and is therefore structural: a `compute`-only declaration cannot
 * SUSPEND (no `judge`, no `confirm`, so no stop point exists), and it cannot produce an EFFECT DESCRIPTOR for
 * {@link ./effect-executor.mjs} to apply (no `effect` step). Both follow from the four kinds and neither is a
 * per-operation promise. That is why #3035's command line drops the `--resume` line for such an operation and
 * why #3036's HTTP adapter derives a GET-only, run-record-free route table from it.
 *
 * WHAT IS **NOT** DERIVED, AND MUST NOT BE READ INTO THE NAME: this says nothing about what a `compute` step's
 * fn does. Nothing here — not `op()`, not this predicate — inspects a step fn's body or its closure. A
 * `compute` fn that closes over `writeFileSync` passes every check in this file, and the HTTP adapter will then
 * serve it on a `GET`. The `compute` contract in {@link ./step-kinds.mjs} ("a pure function plus its declared
 * reads") is a contract the DECLARATION AUTHOR keeps; the engine enforces only the reads.
 *
 * The repo narrows that gap for its own declarations with a static import-graph assertion — a module that
 * declares a read-only operation must reach nothing that can act, so its step fns hold no writer in lexical
 * scope. See `__tests__/http-adapter.test.mjs`, which also states exactly what that check does not cover.
