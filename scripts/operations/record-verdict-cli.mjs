/**
 * @file scripts/operations/record-verdict-cli.mjs
 * @description #3540 — `record-verdict`, MADE SELF-SUFFICIENT ON A HOST WITH NO `gh`.
 *
 * THE DEADLOCK THIS CLOSES (see the card, #3540 — found driving #1961 to a verdict with no operator).
 * `record-verdict`'s `read` step refuses without a staged write-up, and the ONLY thing that ever staged one was
 * `review-pr`'s OWN `record` step — which ALSO swaps the label, and that half needs `gh`. So reaching the
 * write-up meant a manual, separate `review-pr --resume=<runId> --answer=accept` first, which then halted on
 * the label swap it could never complete on a credential-less host: a clean, agent-reviewable accept recorded
 * as an indistinguishable `effect-halted` run.
 *
 * #3540's split (`review-pr.mjs`'s `stageVerdict` step, ahead of `record`) makes the write-up reachable with NO
 * `gh` at all — but something still has to ANSWER `review-pr`'s `confirm` and apply that ONE step's effect
 * before `record-verdict` can read it. This file is that something: a THIN entry point, in the same shape as
 * `we:scripts/operations/review-loop-cli.mjs`, that does the local, `gh`-free half of driving `review-pr`
 * forward (`we:scripts/operations/record-verdict-io.mjs#advanceReviewPrToWriteUp`) before handing off to the
 * exact same `record-verdict` declaration and command line every other caller uses.
 *
 *   node scripts/operations/record-verdict-cli.mjs --runId=<review-pr-run-id> --to=accepted
 *
 * WHY A SEPARATE ENTRY POINT AND NOT A FLAG ON `run.mjs record-verdict`. Same reasoning as
 * `review-loop-cli.mjs`'s own header: `runOperationCli` drives every declared operation uniformly, and folding
 * a `review-pr`-specific pre-pass into it would let every OTHER operation's caller reach into a concern that is
 * not its own — the same "a declaration's own concern leaking into the shared adapter" shape this codebase
 * already refuses elsewhere.
 *
 * PURELY ADDITIVE ON THE REVIEW-PR RUN. A run that is not genuinely `awaiting-confirm`, or a `to` that names no
 * `review-pr` confirm answer (`clear-human`), passes through UNCHANGED (see `confirmAnswerFor` in
 * `review-pr.mjs`) — this never invents a decision, it only carries out the one the caller's own `--to` already
 * states. `record-verdict`'s OWN declaration, its refusals and its command line are UNTOUCHED: this file wraps
 * them, it does not re-implement them.

    // `record-verdict`'s own `plan` step would reject on arrival (e.g. a stray `operatorInstruction` on a
