/**
 * @file scripts/operations/scaffold-io.mjs
 * @description THE IO SHELL of the `scaffold` declaration (#xrrpfo7) — the reader its `read` step is
 *   injected with, and the sink its `write` effect is applied through.
 *
 * IT READS TWO FACTS AND NOTHING ELSE: the existing id set (the allocator's whole input) and today's date.
 * Everything the item becomes is decided in the pure plan, so the sink writes bytes it did not choose — which
 * is what makes the #2288 collision retry testable with no filesystem.
 *
 * THE WRITE GOES THROUGH THE GUARDED WRITER, never a bare `writeFileSync`. That writer owns the
 * lane-not-primary refusal AND the #883 locus scan, and the scan is not incidental here: it fired three times
 * while cards were being filed on 2026-08-21, each time FAIL-CLOSED with nothing written and the fix named in
 * the message. A scaffold that wrote around it would turn that into a card that lands and reddens CI.
 *
 * IMPURE by construction: `fs`.
