/**
 * @file scripts/operations/live-work-io.mjs
 * @description The IO shell for `./live-work.mjs` (card x20lkf6, epic #3931). Every real read the RUNNING
 * section needs lives here, ADDING NO SECOND IMPLEMENTATION of a read another module already owns:
 *
 *   1. `createAgentActivityReader` (`./agent-activity-io.mjs`, card #3932) — the SAME `claude agents --json` +
 *      review-job + subagent + lane-lease + (with `all: true`) interactive-session sweep that operation's own
 *      declared op uses, called here with `all: true` so the operator's own interactive chats are in scope
 *      (the brief's own "the operator's interactive chats" bullet) — never a second directory walk.
 *   2. `collectHeavyQueue` / `assessHeavyQueue` (`./heavy-queue-io.mjs` / `./heavy-queue.mjs`, card xb0iuxq) —
 *      called and ASSESSED here exactly like `live-state-io.mjs` already does for its own `testQueue` section,
 *      so `./live-work.mjs#waitingForSlotWhos` reads the SAME already-classified WAITING rows.
 *   3. `pidAlive` (`./review-job-store.mjs`) — the SAME three-valued pid probe (EPERM = alive, ESRCH = dead)
 *      `listReviewJobAgents` already uses to prune dead job records, reused here for EVERY row that carries a
 *      `pid` (background sessions, review jobs alike), not just review jobs.
 *
 * THE ONE NEW PRIMITIVE: "last activity" — no existing operation reads a transcript/log's own mtime, so this
 * file adds it (`statMtimeMs`), applied to whatever `transcriptPath` `agent-activity-io.mjs` already computed
 * per row (this card's own small addition to that file — see its header) rather than re-deriving the path.
