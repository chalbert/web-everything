/**
 * @file scripts/operations/record-verdict.mjs
 * @description THE `record-verdict` DECLARATION (#xrk6hmj, under epic #3029) — carry a review verdict from a
 *   host that cannot authenticate to GitHub to the CI job that can.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. `review-pr`'s own `record` effect shells `we:scripts/review-set-label.mjs`, which needs `gh`.
 * On a cloud VM no local process holds a GitHub credential and none can be given one, so that step fails and
 * the verdict has to travel another way: as a FILE pushed to `ops/review-requests`, which
 * `we:.github/workflows/apply-review-request.yml` applies by running the real label CLI. That transport works.
 * What it did not have was a caller — it was hand-assembled from a shell one-liner every time, eight times in
 * one session.
 *
 * THE DEFECT THAT MAKES IT WORTH DECLARING is not tedium, it is the retyping. Each hand-rolled request restated
 * the PR number, the repo, the actor and the session id in a fresh `JSON.stringify`, next to a body path copied
 * from a directory listing. A wrong number there records a verdict on the WRONG PR — the same class #1466 fixed
 * on the reading side, where a mis-staged view silently reviewed a different PR than the one named.
 *
 * SO THE INPUT IS A RUN ID, NOT A VERDICT. Everything factual is read back out of the run record the review
 * itself wrote: `input.pr`, `input.repo`, the juror's `sessionId` from telemetry, and the staged write-up on
 * disk. The operator supplies only what is genuinely a decision — which verdict, and (for `clear-human`) the
 * instruction authorising it. There is no `--pr` flag to get wrong.
 *
 * IT DOES NOT RE-DECIDE ANYTHING. The request's shape and every refusal on it live in
 * `we:scripts/apply-review-request.mjs` (`validateRequest`, `APPLIABLE_TARGETS`, `CLEARANCE_FIELD`) and are
 * IMPORTED here, never restated. A second validator would be a second answer to "is this request legal", and
 * the two would drift — the mistake `verify` made against `verify-lane.mjs` before it was corrected.

// it stages a request file for a CI job that will — so the refusal has to be reachable here on its own, or a
// cloud runner's bounce is only caught minutes later in a workflow log nobody reads. Importing the predicate is
// what makes this a second enforcement point rather than a second ANSWER; a second answer is what drifts.
//
// FROM THE LEAF, NOT FROM THE SINGLE HOME. `we:scripts/review-set-label.mjs` re-exports these and would be the
// obvious source, but it reaches `node:child_process` through `computeNetDiffText`, and this file's suite
// asserts `importGraph(...).external` is EMPTY — a declaration that can shell out could stage-and-push straight
// from a `compute` step, where no effect ledger would ever show it happened. The rule is shareable without that
// trade: `we:scripts/lib/reasonless-bounce.mjs` imports nothing at all.
