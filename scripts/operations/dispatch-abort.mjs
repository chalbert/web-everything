/**
 * @file scripts/operations/dispatch-abort.mjs
 * @description SAFELY STOP AND CLOSE OUT ONE DISPATCHED AGENT — the recurring by-hand sequence from #3383's
 *   2026-08-31 live-fire session, mechanized (the operator's own request: "prefer the creation of operation
 *   for all recurring commands").
 *
 * WHAT WENT WRONG WITHOUT IT. That session stopped a stuck dispatched agent with a raw OS `kill <pid>` instead
 * of `claude stop <id>`. `kill` ends the process; it does not deregister the session, and whatever keeps
 * background sessions resumable (the same machinery that backs the mobile "remote agent" view) brought it back
 * under a NEW pid minutes later — twice, across two different scratch clones. One resurrection raced a second,
 * legitimate dispatch onto the same lane, producing a real double-dispatch onto `lane-5` (caught and cleaned up
 * by hand; no damage done, because the lane was still clean when found). `claude stop <id>` does not have this
 * problem — every stop that session issued through it never came back.
 *
 * THE COMPOSITION THIS FILE OWNS: stop, THEN close out — in that order, so `we:scripts/operations/wake.mjs`'s
 * own `assertHandleNotLive` passes NATURALLY instead of needing `--force`. `--force` exists for the case
 * `wake.mjs`'s header names — a listing that cannot be read, or an operator who already knows by other means
 * the agent is gone — not for "I did not stop it properly first." This file's whole job is to make the
 * properly-first path as easy to reach for as the unsafe one.
 *
 * TRUST IS A SEPARATE, SMALLER PIECE, same file because the same session hit both gaps back to back:
 * `we:scripts/bootstrap-session.mjs`'s own `trustableDirs()` only ever trusts the primary checkout and
 * lane-pool lanes — never an ad-hoc scratch clone, which is exactly what #3353's live-run protocol calls for
 * (a checkout named anything other than `lane-N`). A fresh scratch clone is therefore ALWAYS untrusted on
 * first use, and a dispatched agent spawned into it stalls on a permission-prompt dialog with nobody there to
 * answer it — the same class of failure the bootstrap's own `trust` step already exists to prevent for lanes,
 * just never extended to cover this one other place agents are spawned into. `trustCheckout` below reuses the
 * exact primitive (`withTrustedDirs`) the bootstrap step already uses, rather than re-deriving it.
 *
 * WHAT THIS FILE DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: release the lane a dispatch may have partially acquired. That is
 * one more judgement (is the lane actually clean? was ANYTHING started before the stop?) layered on top of two
 * already-real ones, and automating it risks silently discarding a dirty tree. `abortDispatch`'s report names
 * the lane from the effect's own payload when one was assigned, so the operator does not have to go looking —
 * releasing it stays a deliberate `node scripts/lane-pool.mjs release --lane=<n> --force` call.
 *
 * IO: `store`, `listAgents` and `exec` are all injected, exactly like `we:scripts/operations/wake.mjs` and
 * `we:scripts/operations/dispatch-lane-io.mjs`. The CLI block at the bottom is the only part that touches the
 * real filesystem, `claude agents --json`, `claude stop` and `~/.claude.json`.

 * merits and this does not need `force: true` for the common case. Mirrors
 * `we:scripts/operations/wake.mjs#closeOutEntry`'s signature closely on purpose; this is that function plus
 * the one step tonight's session kept doing by hand in front of it.
 *
 * STOPS UNCONDITIONALLY RATHER THAN PRE-CHECKING LIVENESS ITSELF, DELIBERATELY. An earlier cut called
 * `listAgents()` here first to decide whether a stop was needed at all — a second, redundant read of the same
 * question `closeOutEntry`'s own `assertHandleNotLive` asks right after, AND one that failed OPEN (silently
 * skipped the stop) on a listing that came back malformed or unreadable, rather than failing closed the way
 * `assertHandleNotLive` and `stampLiveness` both do. `claude stop` on an already-gone handle is cheap and
 * benign (see {@link stopSession}), so there is no case where skipping the pre-check costs anything but one
 * subprocess call, and it removes an entire way this could get the fail-open case wrong.
 *
 * @param {object} o
 * @param {string} o.runId

 * @param {'failed'|'applied'} [o.status]
 * @param {string} [o.note]
 * @param {boolean} [o.force] - passed straight through to `closeOutEntry` — the same escape hatch
 *   `wake.mjs --resolve --force` offers, for when `claude agents --json` itself is unreadable.
 * @param {{read: Function, write: Function}} o.store
 * @param {() => object[]} [o.listAgents]
