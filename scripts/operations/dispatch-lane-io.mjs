/**
 * @file scripts/operations/dispatch-lane-io.mjs
 * @description THE IO SHELL of the `dispatch-lane` declaration (#3037, under epic #3029) — the tick reader its
 *   `read` step is injected with, the SINK that starts the agent, and the OBSERVER that later asks how it is
 *   going.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A SEPARATE FILE. {@link ./dispatch-lane.mjs} is the declaration: what the operation IS. This is the
 * only place it touches the world — the same pure-core / io-shell split {@link ./review-pr-io.mjs} uses, and
 * what lets the declaration be unit-tested with a stub reader and a stub spawner.
 *
 * EVERY BINDING HERE SHELLS SOMETHING THAT ALREADY EXISTS. Nothing in this file decides anything about a
 * dispatch:
 *   - the whole tick — guards, TTLs, lane exclusion, the re-dispatch gate, watcher arming — is ONE call to
 *     `we:scripts/conveyor/tick-core.mjs`, the same CLI the runner drives, with the caller's bookkeeping on
 *     STDIN exactly as the skill pipes it. Not `conveyor-state` + `dispatch-plan` re-composed here: that
 *     composition IS the tick core, and re-doing it is how a second, subtly different dispatcher gets born;
 *   - item identity is `normNum` (`we:scripts/conveyor/queue-store.mjs`) — the ONE normalizer the state read,
 *     the plan and the core all key on;
 *   - the item's slug and repo-qualified `scope:` come from the canonical backlog loader (`we:src/_data/backlog.js`),
 *     the same source `dispatch-plan.mjs` enriches its queue rows from;
 *   - the brief is whichever of the three authored mandates the launch's KIND names — the delivery brief for
 *     a build, `prepare-scope-agent-brief.md` / `prepare-decision-agent-brief.md` for a prepare (#3165) —
 *     read as text and filled by the declaration.
 *
 * THE SINK IS THE ONLY THING IN THIS REPO THAT STARTS AN AGENT. Read {@link createDispatchSinks} before
 * changing it — the handle contract lives there, and it is the reason a restart can still find the build.
 *
 * IMPURE by construction: `node`, `claude`, `fs`.

// @cohesive: ONE operation's io boundary, which is what this repo's pure-core/io-shell pairing makes a single
// responsibility — `dispatch-lane.mjs` is the WHAT and this is the only place it touches the world, exactly as
// `review-pr.mjs` / `review-pr-io.mjs` are paired. The three things inside it (the tick READER the `read` step
// is injected with, the SINK that starts the agent, the OBSERVER that later asks how it is going) are the
// #3084 effect contract's own three halves for ONE effect type: they are registered under one `DISPATCH_EFFECT`
// string, they share the handle contract the sink's docblock owns, and every consumer imports them together.
// Splitting them into three modules would put one operation's io across three lane-lease scopes while leaving
// that contract split across them — fragmenting a cohesive file to hit a number, which #2678's own ruling says
// cohesion outranks.
//
// WHAT THIS MARKER DOES NOT EXCUSE, stated so it is not read as a blank cheque: the size+collision composite is
// telling the truth about the CONTENTION — 6 queued items name this file, and they do serialize on it. The
// answer to that is #3118's question of where headless spawning finally lives, not a split of the io shell
// underneath it. Added by #3165, which grew the file from 792 to 826 code lines past the 800 line.

 * back off the listing — so the dispatcher's chosen handle now rides the NAME, and this compares against it.
 * See {@link mintDispatchHandle} for the mint that makes that handle unique.
 *
 * `sessionId` IS STILL COMPARED, for two live reasons rather than for symmetry. An entry whose real id has

 * running `wake --resolve` on a handle they copied out of `claude agents --json` is holding a session id
 * rather than a name, and the `handle` branch accepts that too.
 *
 * MORE THAN ONE MATCH IS NOT A MATCH, and that half is load-bearing. Names are NOT unique in a real listing:
 * `./__fixtures__/claude-agents-payload.json` — 14 rows, measured off a live machine — carries
 * `conveyor-3154` THREE times and `conveyor-3151` twice, because the pre-#3331 dispatcher named every attempt
 * for one item identically. Returning the first would report a DIFFERENT dispatch's liveness under this
 * entry's handle, which is strictly worse than reporting nothing: the double-dispatch guard would hold a lane

 *
 * WHY THE SLUG ALONE WOULD NOT DO, which is the whole reason a token is here. `payload.sessionSlug ||

 * keeps `supersededHandles` precisely because a retry mints a fresh handle while the old one may still be

/**
 * ASK `claude agents --json` WHETHER EACH IN-FLIGHT DISPATCH IS STILL ALIVE, and stamp the answer onto its row.
 *
 * WHY THE GUARD NEEDS THIS AT ALL (PR #1211 round 2, G1). The double-dispatch guard used to release a record
 * purely on wall-clock age, on the reasoning that an entry past its deadline "either finished or died". The
 * observer's other answer is `running`, and nothing bounds it — a background session stalled on a permission
 * prompt is alive, holds no lane lease and has claimed no item, so the tick core sees a clear row and the
 * clock-only guard hands out the same lane to a SECOND agent. Liveness is the axis that answers the question
 * the guard is actually asking; age is only the backstop for a record nothing can be observed about.
 *
 * THE THREE ANSWERS, and why an absent one is not silence:
 *   - `live: true` — the handle is in the listing. `dispatchStillHolds` holds it at any age.
 *   - `live: false` — the listing was read and this handle is not in it. Ages out once past the listing grace.
 *   - `live: null` — the row has no handle (an INDETERMINATE dispatch), or the listing could not be read at
 *     all. Falls to the clock backstop, and `livenessSource: 'unreadable'` rides the read onto the VERDICT so
 *     a weaker guard never looks like the strong one.
 *
 * ONE LISTING PER READ, and NONE when there is nothing in flight — the common case is an item with no open
 * dispatch, and shelling `claude` to ask about zero handles would put a subprocess on every dispatch path.
 *
 * IT NEVER THROWS. A `claude` that is missing, wedged or answering nonsense degrades the guard to its clock
 * backstop and says so; it must not take down a dispatch read, which is also the tick read.
 *
 * @param {{runs?: object[], unreadable?: number}} inFlight - what {@link inFlightDispatchesFor} returned.

 * STAMP `lastSeenLiveAt` BACK ONTO EVERY EFFECT ENTRY A LISTING READ JUST CONFIRMED ALIVE.

 * on it (`dispatch-lane.mjs#dispatchStillHolds`) is pure and sees only what rides the row, so without a
 * durable record of "a real listing said `true` at this instant" the only age it can measure is the age of the
 * DISPATCH — and a build that has been running for an hour is then one bad read away from having its lane
 * released, because an hour is past any grace window. The confirmation is the thing worth remembering.
 *
 * IT IS `last`, NOT `first`. Every confirmation overwrites: the property being bought is *"a bad read arriving
 * right after a real seen-alive cannot release the item"*, and only the MOST RECENT confirmation can buy it.
 * Stamping once and never again would leave a long-lived agent anchored on a timestamp from its first minute,
 * which is the `startedAt` failure this replaces wearing a different field name.
 *
 * BEST-EFFORT, AND SILENT ON FAILURE — deliberately. This is a bookkeeping improvement on a READ path that is
 * also the dispatch path; a store that cannot be written must not take down the dispatch read. The cost of the
 * write not landing is the previous behaviour (the guard falls back to `startedAt`), which is fail-closed in
 * the direction that matters: a missing anchor makes the guard age from an EARLIER instant, so it releases
 * sooner, never later than before this change.

 *
 * WHY IT IS WORTH STORING AT ALL, since {@link findListedSession} already matches on the name. Because the

 * bookkeeping: `bookkeeping`, `signals`, `config` and `lastOperatorTurn`. `config` sets `buildTtlTicks`,
 * `fixRetryCap` and friends; `signals.returnedBuildNums` retires live build guards outright. So piping the file

 *
 * DROPPING `signals` IS CONSERVATIVE; DROPPING `config` IS NOT, and the first version of this note claimed both
 * were. `signals.returnedBuildNums` only ever RETIRES guards, so losing it keeps them live longer and dispatches
 * less. `config` cuts both ways: a caller running `buildTtlTicks: 10` who names their file gets the shipped
 * default of 3 instead, so their guards expire SOONER here than in their own tick and this operation can
 * dispatch a lane they still consider held. Dropping it is still right — it is the knob an attacker or a
 * fat-fingered file would reach for — but it is a trade, not a free win, which is why the drops are REPORTED:

 * THE SINK — the one thing in this repo that starts a delivery agent.
 *
 * THE HANDLE IS MINTED, NOT DISCOVERED, and that is still the load-bearing detail — but it is minted into a
 * field the CLI actually keeps (#3331). The #3030 spike established that `sessionId` is the durable handle and
 * `pid` must never be one (the OS reuses it), and read the id back out of `claude agents --json`. Reading it
 * back needs a before/after diff of the live session list and races every other session that starts in the
 * same instant, so this file mints instead of racing, and that has not changed.
 *
 * WHAT CHANGED IS THE CARRIER, AND THE OLD ONE WAS A NO-OP. An earlier version of this comment said
 * `claude --session-id <uuid>` "removes the race outright". It does not: `claude --bg` **DISCARDS**
 * `--session-id` and prints `warning: --bg manages the session id; ignoring --session-id (use --resume <id> to
 * continue an existing session)`. Measured on CLI 2.1.246 over three runs, 3 of 3 mismatched — the #3331
 * probe, whose table is in `we:backlog/3331-*.md`. Every handle this file minted was therefore unfindable, and
 * the observer's liveness axis could never match. The mint now rides `-n` ({@link mintDispatchHandle}), which
 * the listing echoes verbatim, and {@link findListedSession} is the one place anything compares against it.
 *
 * `--session-id` IS NOT BROKEN IN GENERAL, and the narrower claim is the true one: the warning is specific to
 * `--bg`. `we:scripts/lib/judge-spawn.mjs` pins a juror's id with the same flag on a HEADLESS (`-p`) spawn and
 * that is untouched by this. Only the backgrounded spawn discards it.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL NOT COVERED, stated rather than papered over: a sink killed between `claude --bg` returning and
 * this function returning loses the handle, and the executor then refuses the entry on replay (it is
 * `in-flight` with a null handle — `inFlightEntries().unknown`). That window is a few milliseconds wide and the
 * failure is VISIBLE and closable with `resolveInFlight`, which is the whole reason #3073 wrote `in-flight`
 * before the sink rather than after.
 *
 * NO PERMISSION FLAGS ARE BAKED IN — but the knob is REACHABLE. `extraArgs` (model, effort, permission mode)
 * defaults to empty, because a dispatcher that hard-coded `--dangerously-skip-permissions` would silently widen
 * every agent it ever launches; that is a decision for whoever runs the conveyor. It is read from
 * {@link AGENT_ARGS_ENV} at the `run.mjs` binding so an operator can actually set it, rather than being a
 * parameter only a test can reach.
 *
 * THE REAL CLI'S RESPONSE TO THIS ARGV IS NOW ASSERTED — it used to say "remains unasserted", and #3331
 * closed that. Three bare `claude --bg` spawns on 2.1.246 established two facts and nothing wider: the CLI
 * DISCARDS `--session-id` under `--bg` (3/3 mismatches, with a stderr warning saying so), and it carries the
 * `-n` name through to `claude agents --json` VERBATIM. That is what this argv is built on now. The evidence
 * table lives in `we:backlog/3331-*.md`.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL NOT PROVEN, stated as narrowly as the probe allows. No dispatch has been fired end to end:
 * the probe ran a one-line prompt with no conveyor, no lane and no brief. A background session's permission
 * mode and the isolation default are the two things a first live run still has to settle; #xaibmeu, which
 * routes the conveyor through this operation, is where that happens. `./__tests__/dispatch-spawn-live.test.mjs`
 * continues to hold the argv against a fake `claude` first on `PATH` — that proves the spelling parses and
 * that `--bg` returns instead of blocking, which is all a stand-in can ever prove.
 *
 * @param {object} [o]
 * @param {string} [o.root] - the cwd the agent starts in. The agent acquires its OWN lane clone (brief step 1),
 *   so this is the checkout it runs `lane-pool acquire` from, never the lane itself.
 * @param {Function} [o.spawnAgent] - injectable `(argv, opts) => stdout`; the default shells `claude`.
 * @param {Function} [o.exec] - the `execFileSync`-shaped call the DEFAULT `spawnAgent` goes through. See
 *   {@link readTick} for why this is a second seam and not the same one.
 * @param {() => string} [o.mintToken] - injectable entropy for {@link mintDispatchHandle}. It is no longer a
 *   session-id minter: the CLI mints the session id itself under `--bg`, and this only disambiguates the NAME
 *   two attempts at one item would otherwise share.
 * @param {() => Date} [o.now] - injectable clock, for `expectedBy`.
 * @param {string[]} [o.extraArgs]
 * @returns {Record<string, Function>} effect type → `async (payload, ctx) => result`.

/**
 * THE OBSERVER — the #3084 half that asks how a dispatched build is going, on TWO axes (#x9ylkp7).
 *
 * WHY LIVENESS ALONE COULD NEVER ANSWER `succeeded`. `claude agents --json` reports LIVENESS: a session is in
 * the list or it is not. It carries no exit status and no outcome. So "the session is gone" collapses
 * *finished cleanly* and *died* into one observation, and the vocabulary has exactly one honest word for that:
 * `unresolved` — terminal for the observer, actionable by a person, WRITES NOTHING. Answering `succeeded` on
 * liveness alone would record `applied` for a build that may have crashed, and the run would advance past the
 * step that exists to react to it. That has not changed and must not.
 *
 * THERE IS A `state` FIELD, AND THIS DELIBERATELY DOES NOT USE IT. An earlier version of the paragraph above
 * said the listing carried "no terminal record for a completed session at all"; that was measured on **2.1.220**
 * and is stale. On **2.1.246** every row carries `state`, and the #3331 probe read `done` on all three of its
 * finished sessions. That is the whole of what was measured. Whether a CRASHED session also reads `done` was
 * NOT probed — and that is precisely the distinction `unresolved` exists to keep, so building on `state`
 * without probing a crash would reintroduce the exact conflation this axis was written to refuse. Probe a
 * crash first; until then `state` is unread, and this comment says why rather than pretending the field is
 * absent.
 *
 * THIS IS WHY `--all` IS NOT PASSED. It also lists COMPLETED sessions, so a finished build would keep reading
 * as `running` forever — the one mistake that makes an observer worse than none.
 *
 * THE REAL COMPLETION SIGNAL IS THE PR, AND IT IS NOW READ. A delivery agent's outcome exists somewhere the
 * agent listing cannot see: the pull request it opened, which `we:scripts/conveyor/pr-watch.mjs` already
 * classifies to a terminal state. {@link classifyDispatchPr} finds this entry's PR by ITEM ID over the head
 * refs and hands it to that same `classifyPr`, so exactly ONE classification — `merged` — reaches `succeeded`.
 * `closed` (abandoned unmerged, or a manual close) and `parked` (mid-review, not failed) are AMBIGUOUS for this
 * purpose and still answer `unresolved`; `pending` means "no verdict from the PR axis" and falls through to the
 * liveness logic below, unchanged. Conflating *terminal* with *succeeded* is the exact bug this axis exists to
 * close, so it is not enough that a PR reached an end state.
 *
 * THE PR AXIS RUNS FIRST, deliberately. A merged PR with a still-listed session is a real and expected shape —
 * the agent's last act is `pr-land`, and it exits some seconds later — and that build IS done. Ordering
 * liveness first would report it `running` for as long as the session lingered, i.e. the axis would be a
 * fallback that the common case never reaches.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES TO RESOLVE ON: a STALE PR. Re-dispatch of one item is a designed path (the executor mints a
 * fresh handle per retry and keeps `supersededHandles`; `dispatch-lane.mjs#dispatchStillHolds` ages a hold out
 * so a second attempt can start at all), and under id-matching a PREDECESSOR's merged PR matches the new entry
 * just as well as its own would. Resolving on it would mark a build that has barely begun `applied` on the
 * strength of an earlier attempt — the same conflation arriving through the back door. So a merge is only this
 * entry's if it happened at or after the entry's `startedAt`; anything else answers `unresolved`.
 *
 * WHAT THE MANUAL PATH STILL COSTS. Nothing here removes `wake.mjs`'s `closeOutEntry`
 * (`--resolve=<runId> --key=<effectKey> --status=applied|failed`): the two coexist, and the manual one remains
 * the answer for every genuinely ambiguous entry — which is still every dispatch that never reaches a PR.
 *
 * ONE LISTING PER PASS, PER AXIS. Both reads are built once per pass and MEMOIZED, so a run with several
 * in-flight entries — or several parked runs in one pass — costs one subprocess each, not one per entry. Build
 * a fresh table for a fresh pass; the CLI at the bottom of `we:scripts/operations/wake.mjs` does exactly that.
 *
 * @param {object} [o]
 * @param {() => object[]} [o.listAgents] - injectable `claude agents --json` reader.
 * @param {() => object[]} [o.listPrs] - injectable `gh pr list` reader. Same seam, same reason: the whole PR
 *   axis is testable with no network and no `gh`.
 * @param {Function} [o.exec] - the `execFileSync`-shaped call the DEFAULT readers go through. See
 *   {@link readTick} for why this is a second seam and not the same one.
 * @param {() => Date} [o.now]
 * @param {Function} [o.recordSessionId] - the write-back hook for the real session id a listing read
 *   discovers. Defaults to {@link persistDiscoveredSessionId}; a seam for the same reason `readTick`'s
 *   `recordLiveness` is one — it is the single WRITE on an otherwise read-only path, and a test that wants the

/**
 * THE PR AXIS, PURE. Which verdict this entry's own PR supports, given one bounded `gh pr list` page.
 *
 * DISCOVERY IS BY ITEM ID OVER THE HEAD REFS, not by branch name — the fork this item ruled (approach 1). A
 * dispatch entry carries NO PR reference and cannot: the payload holds `num`, `lane`, `sessionSlug`,
 * `itemSpecPath`, `scope`, `prompt`, `expectedWithinMinutes`, and the head ref is minted LATER by the agent
 * itself (`pr-land --ref=lane/{{ITEM_NUM}}-<slug>`, with the slug invented at that moment). So the exact ref is
 * unknowable at observe time and `gh pr list --head` could only ever return empty. The repo already solved
 * this: {@link laneRefItemNum} — pure, unit-tested, shared with the lease reaper — is the matcher, so the two
 * can never disagree about which ref belongs to which item.
 *
 * THE STALE GUARD IS THE HONEST COST OF ID-MATCHING. Ids match a predecessor's PR as well as this build's, so a
 * merge only counts when it happened at or after `startedAt` (which every in-flight entry carries — the
 * executor stamps it, and re-stamps it on every retry). A MISSING or unparseable `startedAt` fails CLOSED: with
 * no instant to compare against, no merge can be attributed, and the verdict is `stale`. The residual this
 * does not close, stated rather than hidden: a predecessor's PR that merges AFTER a retry started is inside the
 * window and would resolve the retry. Only a PR number stored on the entry could tell those apart, and that is
 * approach 2 — a persisted field, a `pr-land`→run-store coupling and a migration, which is not this item.
 *
 * VERDICT PRIORITY among the PRs that survive the stale filter: `merged` > `pending` > `parked` > `closed`.
 * `pending` outranks the two ambiguous terminals on purpose — an item with an abandoned PR AND a live open one
 * must keep waiting on the live one, the same "open wins" safety the reaper's `prStatesFromList` applies for
 * the same reason (the #2267 data-loss case, from the other side).

/**
 * `claude agents --json` — active sessions only. See {@link createDispatchObservers} for why not `--all`.
 *
 * BOUNDED, because this call sits synchronously inside a waker pass that promises to be fail-soft per run: a
 * `claude` that blocks (a cold start that wants to ask something, a wedged daemon) would otherwise stall every
 * OTHER parked run in the pass. A timeout turns that into one reported observer error, which is what the
 * contract says should happen.
 *
 * ASSERTED, not merely asserted-about. This function was called by no test at all, so both of the emphatic
 * claims above it — no `--all`, and a timeout — could be inverted with the suite green (PR #1211 review, F5/F6).
 * `dispatch-lane-defaults.test.mjs` now pins the argv and the opts, and the wake CLI test proves the same argv
 * across a real process boundary.
 *
 * @param {{exec?: Function, env?: object}} [io] - injected ONLY so the argv and opts can be asserted.
