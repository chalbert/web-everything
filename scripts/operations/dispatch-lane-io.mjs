/**
 * @file scripts/operations/dispatch-lane-io.mjs
 * @description THE IO SHELL of the `dispatch-lane` declaration (#3037, under epic #3029) — the tick reader its
 *   `read` step is injected with, the SINK that starts the agent, and the OBSERVER that later asks how it is
 *   going.
 *
 * WHY IT IS A SEPARATE FILE. {@link ./dispatch-lane.mjs} is the declaration: what the operation IS. This is the
 * only place it touches the world — the same pure-core / io-shell split {@link ./review-pr-io.mjs} uses, and
 * what lets the declaration be unit-tested with a stub reader and a stub spawner.
 *
 * EVERY BINDING HERE SHELLS SOMETHING THAT ALREADY EXISTS. Nothing in this file decides anything about a
 * dispatch:
 *   - the whole tick — guards, TTLs, lane exclusion, the re-dispatch gate, watcher arming — is ONE call to
 *     `we:scripts/conveyor/tick-core.mjs`, the same CLI the runner drives, with the caller's bookkeeping on
 *     STDIN exactly as the skill pipes it. Not `conveyor-state` + `dispatch-plan` re-composed here: that
 *     composition IS the tick core, and re-doing it is how a second, subtly different dispatcher gets born;
 *   - item identity is `normNum` (`we:scripts/conveyor/queue-store.mjs`) — the ONE normalizer the state read,
 *     the plan and the core all key on;
 *   - the item's slug and repo-qualified `scope:` come from the canonical backlog loader (`we:src/_data/backlog.js`),
 *     the same source `dispatch-plan.mjs` enriches its queue rows from;
 *   - the brief is whichever of the SIX authored mandates the launch's KIND names — the delivery brief for
 *     a build, `prepare-scope-agent-brief.md` / `prepare-decision-agent-brief.md` for a prepare (#3165), and
 *     `fix-agent-brief.md` / `fix-agent-ci-brief.md` for a fix / ci-heal repair (#3332) —
 *     read as text and filled by the declaration.
 *
 * THE SINK IS THE ONLY THING IN THIS REPO THAT STARTS AN AGENT. Read {@link createDispatchSinks} before
 * changing it — the handle contract lives there, and it is the reason a restart can still find the build.
 *
 * IMPURE by construction: `node`, `claude`, `fs`.

// @cohesive: ONE operation's io boundary, which is what this repo's pure-core/io-shell pairing makes a single
// responsibility — `dispatch-lane.mjs` is the WHAT and this is the only place it touches the world, exactly as
// `review-pr.mjs` / `review-pr-io.mjs` are paired. The three things inside it (the tick READER the `read` step
// is injected with, the SINK that starts the agent, the OBSERVER that later asks how it is going) are the
// #3084 effect contract's own three halves for ONE effect type: they are registered under one `DISPATCH_EFFECT`
// string, they share the handle contract the sink's docblock owns, and every consumer imports them together.
// Splitting them into three modules would put one operation's io across three lane-lease scopes while leaving
// that contract split across them — fragmenting a cohesive file to hit a number, which #2678's own ruling says
// cohesion outranks.
//
// WHAT THIS MARKER DOES NOT EXCUSE, stated so it is not read as a blank cheque: the size+collision composite is
// telling the truth about the CONTENTION — 6 queued items name this file, and they do serialize on it. The
// answer to that is #3118's question of where headless spawning finally lives, not a split of the io shell
// underneath it. Added by #3165, which grew the file from 792 to 826 code lines past the 800 line.

 * READ ONE TICK and select this item's row. The `readTick` the declaration is injected with.

 * when given, `{}` otherwise. The file is the CALLER'S (the runner's `nextState`); this function neither
 * creates nor writes one, so no parallel state store comes into existence (#2612).
 *
 * @param {object} o
 * @param {string|number} o.num - the item to dispatch.
 * @param {string} [o.bookkeepingFile] - path to the caller's `{ bookkeeping, signals, config }` JSON.
 * @param {string} [o.root]
 * @param {Function} [o.runNode] - injectable `(argv, opts) => stdout`, so the reader is testable without a tick.
 * @param {Function} [o.exec] - the `execFileSync`-shaped call the DEFAULT `runNode` goes through. Separate from
 *   `runNode` on purpose: overriding `runNode` replaces the production path, while overriding `exec` EXERCISES
 *   it, which is the only way a test can assert the options (the timeout) it builds — see F5/F12 in the PR
 *   #1211 review, where a tested default reached by nothing was the whole defect.
 * @param {Function} [o.readText] - injectable file reader.
 * @param {Function} [o.loadItems] - injectable backlog loader.
 * @param {() => Date} [o.now] - injectable clock; stamps `observedAt`, which is how the pure declaration ages
 *   its double-dispatch guard out without reading a clock of its own.
 * @param {() => object[]} [o.listAgents] - injectable `claude agents --json` reader. The double-dispatch
 *   guard's PRIMARY axis is liveness, not age (PR #1211 round 2, G1), so the read asks the same question the
 *   observer asks and stamps the answer onto each in-flight row.
 * @param {(stamped: object) => object} [o.recordLiveness] - the write-back hook. Defaults to
 *   {@link persistLastSeenLive}, which stamps `lastSeenLiveAt` onto every entry this read just confirmed
 *   alive. A seam, not decoration: it is the one WRITE on an otherwise read-only path, and a test that wants
 *   the read without touching a run store overrides it with the identity.
 * @param {(pr: string|number) => (string|null)} [o.laneRefForPr] - injectable `gh pr view --json headRefName`
 *   reader (#3332). Defaults to {@link defaultLaneRefForPr}. Called ONLY for a `fix`/`ci-heal` launch that
 *   carries a `pr` — see the call site below for why it is this lazy.
 * @param {(num: string) => {done: boolean, pr: object|null, checked: boolean}} [o.checkAlreadyDone] -
 *   injectable ALREADY-DONE ground-truth reader (#3457/#3460). Defaults to {@link defaultCheckAlreadyDone}.
 *   Called ONLY when the core actually cleared this item for SOME launch — see the call site below for why.

/**
 * ASK `claude agents --json` WHETHER EACH IN-FLIGHT DISPATCH IS STILL ALIVE, and stamp the answer onto its row.

 * WHY THE GUARD NEEDS THIS AT ALL (PR #1211 round 2, G1). The double-dispatch guard used to release a record
 * purely on wall-clock age, on the reasoning that an entry past its deadline "either finished or died". The
 * observer's other answer is `running`, and nothing bounds it — a background session stalled on a permission
 * prompt is alive, holds no lane lease and has claimed no item, so the tick core sees a clear row and the
 * clock-only guard hands out the same lane to a SECOND agent. Liveness is the axis that answers the question
 * the guard is actually asking; age is only the backstop for a record nothing can be observed about.
 *
 * THE THREE ANSWERS, and why an absent one is not silence:
 *   - `live: true` — the handle is in the listing. `dispatchStillHolds` holds it at any age.
 *   - `live: false` — the listing was read and this handle is not in it. Ages out once past the listing grace.
 *   - `live: null` — the row has no handle (an INDETERMINATE dispatch), or the listing could not be read at
 *     all. Falls to the clock backstop, and `livenessSource: 'unreadable'` rides the read onto the VERDICT so
 *     a weaker guard never looks like the strong one.
 *
 * ONE LISTING PER READ, and NONE when there is nothing in flight — the common case is an item with no open
 * dispatch, and shelling `claude` to ask about zero handles would put a subprocess on every dispatch path.
 *
 * IT NEVER THROWS. A `claude` that is missing, wedged or answering nonsense degrades the guard to its clock

 * durable record of "a real listing said `true` at this instant" the only age it can measure is the age of the
 * DISPATCH — and a build that has been running for an hour is then one bad read away from having its lane
 * released, because an hour is past any grace window. The confirmation is the thing worth remembering.
 *
 * IT IS `last`, NOT `first`. Every confirmation overwrites: the property being bought is *"a bad read arriving
 * right after a real seen-alive cannot release the item"*, and only the MOST RECENT confirmation can buy it.
 * Stamping once and never again would leave a long-lived agent anchored on a timestamp from its first minute,
 * which is the `startedAt` failure this replaces wearing a different field name.
 *
 * BEST-EFFORT, AND SILENT ON FAILURE — deliberately. This is a bookkeeping improvement on a READ path that is
 * also the dispatch path; a store that cannot be written must not take down the dispatch read. The cost of the
 * write not landing is the previous behaviour (the guard falls back to `startedAt`), which is fail-closed in
 * the direction that matters: a missing anchor makes the guard age from an EARLIER instant, so it releases
 * sooner, never later than before this change.

 * this module deliberately does not touch.
 *
 * IT THROWS `notApplied`, so the entry lands `failed` — and the executor retries `failed` with no cap. The
 * condition is PERMANENT (a checkout does not rename itself), so such a run re-attempts an impossible dispatch
 * on every waker pass until a person closes it out. It is bounded in the only way that matters — nothing is

/**
 * THE SINK — the one thing in this repo that starts a delivery agent.
 *
 * THE HANDLE IS THE ONE THE CLI PRINTS BACK — NOT A MINTED ONE. CORRECTED 2026-09-11 (#3331); this paragraph
 * used to read *"THE HANDLE IS MINTED, NOT DISCOVERED, and that is the load-bearing detail … `claude
 * --session-id <uuid>` removes the race outright: the dispatcher CHOOSES the id"*, and that was the discarded
 * assumption stated as the design's load-bearing detail. `claude --bg` IGNORES `--session-id` (measured 3/3 at
 * CLI 2.1.246 by #3331's probe, re-measured 2/2 at 2.1.269 with the real dispatch argv; the CLI says so itself
 * on stderr), so every "minted" handle addressed a session that never existed.
 *
 * What IS true from the #3030 spike still stands: a session id is the durable handle and `pid` must never be
 * one (the OS reuses it). What replaces the mint is neither a mint nor the spike's before/after listing diff —
 * both of which the spike rightly called racy — but the id `claude --bg` PRINTS on its own stdout for the
 * session it just started (`backgrounded · <id> · <name>`, {@link parseBackgroundedId}). That is
 * race-free by construction: it is this spawn's own output, attributable to no other session, available
 * synchronously, and it is the listing's `id` field on a background row. See {@link buildAgentArgv} and
 * {@link defaultClaudeProvider}.
 *
 * WHAT IS STILL NOT COVERED, stated rather than papered over: a sink killed between `claude --bg` returning and
 * this function returning loses the handle, and the executor then refuses the entry on replay (it is
 * `in-flight` with a null handle — `inFlightEntries().unknown`). That window is a few milliseconds wide and the
 * failure is VISIBLE and closable with `resolveInFlight`, which is the whole reason #3073 wrote `in-flight`
 * before the sink rather than after.
 *
 * NO PERMISSION FLAGS ARE BAKED IN — but the knob is REACHABLE. `extraArgs` (model, effort, permission mode)
 * defaults to empty, because a dispatcher that hard-coded `--dangerously-skip-permissions` would silently widen
 * every agent it ever launches; that is a decision for whoever runs the conveyor. It is read from
 * {@link AGENT_ARGS_ENV} at the `run.mjs` binding so an operator can actually set it, rather than being a
 * parameter only a test can reach.
 *
 * PROVEN AGAINST A PROCESS *AND*, SINCE #3331, AGAINST THE REAL CLI ON THE ONE POINT THAT MATTERED.
 * `./__tests__/dispatch-spawn-live.test.mjs` starts a `claude` executable — a fake first on `PATH` that parses
 * options the way a commander-style CLI does — and asserts this argv is ACCEPTED and that `--bg` returns
 * instead of blocking. A FAKE CANNOT SETTLE WHO OWNS THE ID, which is precisely how the discarded
 * `--session-id` survived: the fake obligingly echoed back whatever it was handed, so the round-trip test was
 * green against an assumption the real CLI had never honoured. That question is now answered live (CLI 2.1.269,
 * 2026-09-11) and the answer is in {@link buildAgentArgv}'s header. What is STILL not proven by a test: a
 * background session's permission mode and the isolation default; #xaibmeu, which routes the conveyor through
 * this operation, is where those settle.
 *
 * ── THE PROVIDER PORT (#3579) ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `provider` is the seam between "an item is ready to dispatch" and "some CLI's argv/stdout" — the boundary
 * this item (#3579) names, mirroring #3370's judge-seam extraction. Its shape is deliberately independent of
 * any one CLI:
 *
 *   request:  {sessionId, cwd, prompt, sessionSlug, num, extraArgs, systemPromptFile}
 *             — a session/item identity, the FILLED brief text, and an expected-duration hint (read by the
 *             caller from `payload.expectedWithinMinutes`, not part of the request itself).
 *   returns:  a durable handle string (or a Promise of one) usable for LATER liveness polling — never a raw
 *             stdout blob or a CLI-shaped result.
 *
 * `defaultClaudeProvider` is ONE implementation of this port, not the port itself: it composes
 * {@link buildAgentArgv} (Claude's argv construction) with the injected `spawnAgent` (the CLI-shaped seam that
 * already existed) and answers with the id `claude --bg` PRINTED — read by {@link parseBackgroundedId} off the
 * spawn's own stdout. It used to answer with the minted `sessionId`; #3331 measured that the CLI discards that
 * value outright, so the port was handing every caller a handle no listing could ever match. The stdout parse
 * is no longer only the resume-detection path's (`resumeSucceeded`); it is where a usable handle comes from.
 *
 * @param {object} [o]
 * @param {string} [o.root] - THIS DISPATCHER'S OWN checkout — never the agent's cwd any more (#4174). Still what
 *   `assertNotALaneCheckout` checks and what the agent's brief is filled with an absolute path to (`{{WE_ROOT}}`),
 *   so it can `lane-pool acquire` before it has a checkout of its own; see {@link dispatchSessionCwd}.
 * @param {Function} [o.spawnAgent] - injectable `(argv, opts) => stdout`; the default shells `claude`. Feeds
 *   the DEFAULT `provider` below; a caller supplying its own `provider` need not touch this at all.
 * @param {Function} [o.exec] - the `execFileSync`-shaped call the DEFAULT `spawnAgent` goes through. See
 *   {@link readTick} for why this is a second seam and not the same one.
 * @param {(request: object) => (string|Promise<string>)} [o.provider] - the PORT (see above). Defaults to
 *   {@link defaultClaudeProvider} closed over `spawnAgent`.
 * @param {() => string} [o.mintSessionId] - injectable UUID minter.
 * @param {() => Date} [o.now] - injectable clock, for `expectedBy`.
 * @param {string[]} [o.extraArgs]
 * @param {(sessionId: string) => string} [o.sessionCwdFor] - #4174 — computes the cwd THIS session actually
 *   starts in. Defaults to {@link dispatchSessionCwd} closed over `root` — a workspace-level scratch directory,
 *   NEVER `root` itself. Injectable so a test can pin it back to a fixed path without touching the filesystem.
 * @param {(dir: string) => string} [o.ensureSessionCwd] - makes that directory exist. Defaults to
 *   {@link ensureDispatchSessionCwd} (never throws). Injectable for the same reason as `sessionCwdFor`.
 * @returns {Record<string, Function>} effect type → `async (payload, ctx) => result`.

 * The `claude` argv for one dispatch. PURE and exported, because the argv IS the contract with the CLI and a

 *
 * `--session-id` IS NOT EMITTED, AND THAT IS THE #3331 FIX — not an omission. Until this change this argv
 * carried `'--session-id', String(sessionId)` and the whole file treated that minted uuid as the spawned
 * session's real identity. It never was. `claude --bg` DISCARDS it and assigns its own id, printing
 * `warning: --bg manages the session id; ignoring --session-id (use --resume <id> to continue an existing
 * session)` on stderr — measured 3/3 by #3331's own probe at CLI 2.1.246 (see that card's table) and
 * re-measured 2/2 at CLI **2.1.269** on 2026-09-11 with THIS exact argv, review brief and deny list included.
 * The cost was never a crash: the session starts fine and does its work (live-verified — `review-2129` ran to
 * a full accept verdict under an id nothing in this repo knew). The cost is that the dispatcher could not
 * ADDRESS what it started — `claude agents --json | grep <minted uuid>` is empty, no transcript exists under
 * that name, so every operator who looked concluded the dispatch had silently failed, and
 * {@link stampLiveness} read `live: false` for every in-flight dispatch, permanently, degrading the
 * double-dispatch guard to its clock backstop.
 *
 * WHERE THE HANDLE COMES FROM NOW: the id `claude --bg` PRINTS on stdout (`backgrounded · <id> · <name>`),
 * read by {@link parseBackgroundedId} and returned as the handle by {@link defaultClaudeProvider}. That short
 * id is the listing's own `id` field on a background row (measured: `fe8b4df8` ↔
 * `fe8b4df8-f682-46e4-a3a8-e7a2b772e88c`), which {@link listedSessionIds} now collects — so liveness matches
 * again. Reading the FULL `sessionId` back out of a post-spawn listing was considered and rejected for the
 * reason {@link resumeSucceeded}'s own docblock measured: a fresh session can take 26+ seconds to appear in
 * `claude agents --json`, which no synchronous spawn path here can afford to wait for.
 *
 * `sessionId` STAYS IN THE SIGNATURE. It is still minted by every caller and still ends up on the run entry as
 * the FALLBACK handle when stdout could not be parsed (see `createDispatchSinks`) — the same not-worse-than-
 * before behaviour — and `#xu2krte`'s resume path addresses a session by an id it learned elsewhere. What it
 * is no longer is a request to the CLI that the CLI ignores.
 *
 * `--append-system-prompt-file` (#xqyyoje), when `systemPromptFile` is given, adds the dispatched agent's
 * standing identity ahead of `extraArgs` and the prompt — a real CLI flag (`claude --help`), unused before this,
 * that gives a dispatched agent a way to tell "who am I, always" apart from "what am I doing right now" instead
 * of both arriving folded into one prompt string. Optional and defaulted to nothing (not
 * {@link DISPATCHED_AGENT_SYSTEM_PROMPT_FILE}) so this function stays PURE — no fs, no implicit path — the
 * caller resolves the real path and decides whether to pass it.
 *
 * THE PROMPT'S POSITION GUARANTEES NOTHING, which the first cut of this comment got wrong. `claude` parses with
 * commander, and commander accepts options intermixed with operands — a last positional beginning with `-` is
 * still read as a flag. Rather than bet on `--` being handled the way this file hopes (untested against the
 * real CLI, and a wrong bet turns into a dispatch with a mangled prompt), the dash is REFUSED outright. Every
 * legitimate brief starts with markdown, so the refusal costs nothing and proves what the position could not.
 *
 * `resumeSessionId` (`#xu2krte`) — OPT-IN, and it changes the WHOLE argv shape, not just one flag. A live
 * build-time probe (CLI 2.1.263, 2026-09-06; see

 * `.lanes/` and of `explore-io.mjs#exploreScratchRoot`'s own scratch root — NEVER `root` itself (the checkout
 * that is dispatching this session).
 *
 * THE BUG THIS CLOSES. `createDispatchSinks` used to spawn every session with `cwd: root` — "the cwd the agent
 * starts in" before its brief's own first step acquires a lane clone of its own. A session that writes a
 * scratch/log file by a RELATIVE path in that window (a real one did, live, 2026-09-25) leaves an untracked
 * file in the DAEMON'S OWN clone. Self-sync then refuses the dirty clone, the clone falls behind `main`, and
 * every dispatch after that refuses as stale-main — measured at 125 invariant violations over 50 soak ticks
 * from ONE junk file (card #4174 / `we:backlog/xm5i1xm`, epic #4075).
 *
 * WHY A WORKSPACE-LEVEL DIRECTORY, not e.g. an ad-hoc `os.tmpdir()` mkdtemp per dispatch: `we:scripts/
 * guard-lane.mjs` denies an `Edit`/`Write` whose real path is inside a primary checkout or a lane clone it does
 * not occupy, and a report/scratch directory OUTSIDE every checkout is exactly the region clause 1 of
 * [#state-lives-where-its-nature-dictates](../../docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#state-lives-where-its-nature-dictates)
 * already puts session scratch in — the SAME region `explore-io.mjs` already uses for a panelist's report, for
 * the identical reason (see that file's own header). Reusing `workspaceRootOf` rather than re-deriving it means
 * "the region a dispatched agent may write to" and "the region this computes" stay one definition.
 *
 * PER-SESSION, not one shared directory: two sessions dispatched close together must never collide on the same
 * filename before either has acquired its own lane.
 *
 * NEVER CLEANED UP HERE. Whatever a session drops before it moves into its lane is harmless clutter (outside
 * every checkout, never read by anything), not a live daemon hazard for #4174's OWN proof — reclaiming it was
 * left to whoever owns `.operations/` scratch generally. UPDATE (#4188, bornAs `x5qketq`, epic #4075): that
 * owner now exists — `we:scripts/conveyor/session-reaper.mjs`'s dispatch-scratch sweep removes a finished
 * session's own folder here (plus the trust entry {@link grantDispatchTrust} granted it, via

 * fail this same way — the exact regression this whole card exists to prevent, reintroduced one layer up.
 *
 * FAIL-SOFT ON PURPOSE, same as `resolveGhShimSettingsEnv`: an unreadable/unparseable trust file writes
 * nothing (never rebuilds an operator's whole per-project CLI state from `{}`), and any other failure (no

 *
 * `id` ON A `background` ROW, MEASURED, TWICE (`#3541`, follow-up from PR #1966's independent review): a live
 * `claude agents --json --all` read (CLI 2.1.263, 2026-09-06) found 259/259 `kind:'background'` rows carrying

 * own header measured for its domain on 2026-09-03 (204/204 vs 0/4). So the scenario this function's own
 * `#x3gdu12` origin story worried about — a `background` row for a genuinely-resumed session silently missing
 * `id` — has never once been observed; `listedSessionIds`'s "absent from roughly half the listing" is entirely
 * the `interactive` half.
 *
 * NO POSITIVE FALLBACK — TWO WERE TRIED, TWO WERE FOUND UNSAFE, AND THE SECOND FAILURE MEASURED WHY THE FIRST
 * COULD NEVER BE PATCHED INTO SAFETY. This item's own build history:
 *   1. A `sessionId`-only fallback (no `id` needed): "no new session appeared anywhere since `agentsBefore`" ⇒
 *      resumed. An independent review round found this could resolve `true` on the FIRST post-resume read, on
 *      the strength of a fork whose row simply had not propagated into the listing yet — the identical lag
 *      `dispatchFix`'s own Hardening 2 retry loop exists to absorb for the id-match path.
 *   2. Gated the same fallback on `isFinalAttempt` (only trust the absence-of-evidence once the retry loop's
 *      last attempt is reached). A SECOND independent review round found this only bounds the wait to
 *      `RESUME_CONFIRM_MAX_ATTEMPTS × RESUME_CONFIRM_WAIT_MS` (~600ms) — and a fork's row can take far longer
 *      than that to appear. MEASURED, not assumed: a live probe (2026-09-07) spawned a fresh `claude --bg`
 *      session and polled `claude agents --json --all` for it every ~700ms — it had STILL not appeared after
 *      26+ seconds, on this same machine, under its ordinary background-session load. No fixed short retry
 *      budget can outrun a lag of that shape, and `dispatchFix` cannot afford to block tens of seconds per
 *      resume attempt either (it "sits synchronously inside a waker pass that promises to stay fail-soft and
 *      fast per run" — see this file's own `TICK_TIMEOUT_MS`/`SPAWN_TIMEOUT_MS` budgets for the same
 *      discipline elsewhere).
 * Both designs answer "no new session — therefore resumed" from ABSENCE of evidence, and absence read against
 * an unbounded-latency listing can never be trusted at any fixed budget. A REJECTED FIX from the item's own
 * origin story, restated because it fails for the identical underlying reason: "is `requestedSessionId` still
 * listed at all" cannot disambiguate either, since the pre-resume session stays listed under EITHER outcome.
 *
 * THE CONCLUSION, stated plainly rather than papered over with a third attempt: there is no way to positively
 * confirm a resume from the listing alone within a budget `dispatchFix` can afford, when the id-match itself
 * comes back empty. So this function does NOT try — on a missing `id`, it answers `resumed:false`, exactly the
 * pre-#3541 behavior, and the caller's existing `stop(printedId)` cleans up (correctly, for an actual fork; a
 * wasted-but-recoverable attempt, for the never-yet-observed missing-`id` shape). This is the safe DIRECTION,
 * argued once and applied consistently: a false stop costs a wasted resume attempt plus a redundant fresh
 * dispatch, and the fix still lands; a false resume reports success while the real work silently never happens
 * (the untouched candidate never sees the new prompt) and leaves an unmanaged forked session running unstopped.
 * Between a residual that has NEVER been observed (missing `id`) and one just MEASURED to be real and immediate
 * (unbounded listing lag), the honest choice is to not trade the second for a hedge against the first.
 *
 * THE ONE THING ADDED: an `anomaly` DIAGNOSTIC, never a verdict input. When the id-match fails but
 * `requestedSessionId` is still listed under a row that carries no `id` at all, that IS the never-observed
 * shape this item was filed to worry about — worth a name on the record for whoever reads the run later, even
 * though it changes nothing about the (safe) `resumed:false` answer.

 * THE OBSERVER — the #3084 half that asks how a dispatched build is going, on TWO axes (#x9ylkp7).
 *
 * WHY LIVENESS ALONE COULD NEVER ANSWER `succeeded`. `claude agents --json` reports LIVENESS: a session is in
 * the list or it is not. It carries no exit status, no outcome, and (measured on 2.1.220, with `--all`) no
 * terminal record for a completed session at all. So "the session is gone" collapses *finished cleanly* and
 * *died* into one observation, and the vocabulary has exactly one honest word for that: `unresolved` —
 * terminal for the observer, actionable by a person, WRITES NOTHING. Answering `succeeded` on liveness alone
 * would record `applied` for a build that may have crashed, and the run would advance past the step that
 * exists to react to it. That has not changed and must not.
 *
 * THIS IS WHY `--all` IS NOT PASSED. It also lists COMPLETED sessions, so a finished build would keep reading
 * as `running` forever — the one mistake that makes an observer worse than none.
 *
 * THE REAL COMPLETION SIGNAL IS THE PR, AND IT IS NOW READ. A delivery agent's outcome exists somewhere the
 * agent listing cannot see: the pull request it opened, which `we:scripts/conveyor/pr-watch.mjs` already
 * classifies to a terminal state. {@link classifyDispatchPr} finds this entry's PR by ITEM ID over the head
 * refs and hands it to that same `classifyPr`, so exactly ONE classification — `merged` — reaches `succeeded`.
 * `closed` (abandoned unmerged, or a manual close) and `parked` (mid-review, not failed) are AMBIGUOUS for this
 * purpose and still answer `unresolved`; `pending` means "no verdict from the PR axis" and falls through to the
 * liveness logic below, unchanged. Conflating *terminal* with *succeeded* is the exact bug this axis exists to
 * close, so it is not enough that a PR reached an end state.
 *
 * THE PR AXIS RUNS FIRST, deliberately. A merged PR with a still-listed session is a real and expected shape —
 * the agent's last act is `pr-land`, and it exits some seconds later — and that build IS done. Ordering
 * liveness first would report it `running` for as long as the session lingered, i.e. the axis would be a
 * fallback that the common case never reaches.
 *
 * WHAT IT REFUSES TO RESOLVE ON: a STALE PR. Re-dispatch of one item is a designed path (the executor mints a
 * fresh handle per retry and keeps `supersededHandles`; `dispatch-lane.mjs#dispatchStillHolds` ages a hold out
 * so a second attempt can start at all), and under id-matching a PREDECESSOR's merged PR matches the new entry
 * just as well as its own would. Resolving on it would mark a build that has barely begun `applied` on the
 * strength of an earlier attempt — the same conflation arriving through the back door. So a merge is only this
 * entry's if it happened at or after the entry's `startedAt`; anything else answers `unresolved`.
 *
 * WHAT THE MANUAL PATH STILL COSTS. Nothing here removes `wake.mjs`'s `closeOutEntry`
 * (`--resolve=<runId> --key=<effectKey> --status=applied|failed`): the two coexist, and the manual one remains
 * the answer for every genuinely ambiguous entry — which is still every dispatch that never reaches a PR.
 *
 * ONE LISTING PER PASS, PER AXIS. Both reads are built once per pass and MEMOIZED, so a run with several
 * in-flight entries — or several parked runs in one pass — costs one subprocess each, not one per entry. Build
 * a fresh table for a fresh pass; the CLI at the bottom of `we:scripts/operations/wake.mjs` does exactly that.
 *
 * @param {object} [o]
 * @param {() => object[]} [o.listAgents] - injectable `claude agents --json` reader.
 * @param {() => object[]} [o.listPrs] - injectable `gh pr list` reader. Same seam, same reason: the whole PR
 *   axis is testable with no network and no `gh`.
 * @param {Function} [o.exec] - the `execFileSync`-shaped call the DEFAULT readers go through. See
 *   {@link readTick} for why this is a second seam and not the same one.
 * @param {() => Date} [o.now]

/**
 * THE PR AXIS, PURE. Which verdict this entry's own PR supports, given one bounded `gh pr list` page.
 *
 * DISCOVERY IS BY ITEM ID OVER THE HEAD REFS, not by branch name — the fork this item ruled (approach 1). A
 * dispatch entry carries NO PR reference and cannot: the payload holds `num`, `lane`, `sessionSlug`,
 * `itemSpecPath`, `scope`, `prompt`, `expectedWithinMinutes`, and the head ref is minted LATER by the agent
 * itself (`pr-land --ref=lane/{{ITEM_NUM}}-<slug>`, with the slug invented at that moment). So the exact ref is
 * unknowable at observe time and `gh pr list --head` could only ever return empty. The repo already solved
 * this: {@link laneRefItemNum} — pure, unit-tested, shared with the lease reaper — is the matcher, so the two
 * can never disagree about which ref belongs to which item.
 *
 * THE STALE GUARD CATCHES A MERGE BEFORE MY START; THE ATTEMPT-TAG GUARD (#3110) CATCHES ONE AFTER IT. Ids
 * match a predecessor's PR as well as this build's, so on their own they answer only WHEN a merge happened,
 * never WHOSE attempt it belongs to. `startedMs` answers the first question (a merge before `startedAt`
 * belongs to a previous attempt); `attempt` answers the second, independently — the two are ANDed, not merged
 * into one check, so neither can quietly redefine what "belongs to this entry" means for the other (the
 * residual this function's own review once flagged: two guards on one function must agree on that, not each
 * invent an answer). A MISSING or unparseable `startedAt` fails CLOSED on the first axis (verdict `stale`); a
 * PR whose OWN attempt tag is resolvable but does not match `attempt` fails closed on the second (excluded
 * from `mine` entirely, before the stale filter even runs — it is not this entry's PR at all, not merely late).
 *
 * `attempt`/a candidate's tag is `''` for an unsuffixed first attempt, `'b'`/`'c'`/… for a retry, or `null` when
 * unresolvable (a legacy dispatch, from before this session slug / branch name ever carried one). `null` on
 * EITHER side degrades to today's tag-blind behaviour (only `startedAt` decides) — so nothing already in
 * flight when this shipped, and no future entry whose slug happens not to parse, loses its existing coverage.
 * The one case this still does not close, per #3110's own filing: an entry resolved and closed OUT before a
 * later retry began (its in-flight record is gone, so it no longer holds a comparable tag) whose PR somehow
 * merges long after — see `we:scripts/operations/dispatch-lane.mjs`'s attempt-count comment for why that
 * residual is bounded to an already-resolved, already-closed-out entry, not a still-open one.
 *
 * VERDICT PRIORITY among the PRs that survive the stale filter: `merged` > `pending` > `parked` > `closed`.
 * `pending` outranks the two ambiguous terminals on purpose — an item with an abandoned PR AND a live open one
 * must keep waiting on the live one, the same "open wins" safety the reaper's `prStatesFromList` applies for
 * the same reason (the #2267 data-loss case, from the other side).
 *
 * @param {object} o
 * @param {string|number|null} o.num - the item id off the entry's payload.
 * @param {string|null} [o.startedAt] - when THIS dispatch attempt started.

 *   4. (#3473) ALL-MARKDOWN DIFF — a PR whose entire changed-file set is `.md` is pure backlog housekeeping,
 *      never a real implementation, however its title reads. Live false positive: `#3096`'s dispatch-time
 *      already-done hold was fed by TWO merged PRs that both title-boundary-match "3096" — PR #1599 (ref
 *      `lane/reconcile-3147-3096-3239`, title "#3096: reconcile the three-way dispatch duplicate — #3096
 *      survives, #3147 + #3239 collapse") whose real merge diff (`git show 90fe066f6 --stat`) touches exactly
 *      4 files, ALL `.md` (3 `backlog/*.md` + a 1-line comment-marker repoint in `skills-src/conveyor/
 *      SKILL.md` — its own PR body opens "No code behaviour changes — this is a backlog reconciliation plus

 *      touches exactly 2 files, both `backlog/*.md` (body opens "No code changes — two backlog files"). This
 *      filter reliably excludes PR #1613 — but NOT PR #1599: `gh`'s own `files` field for that long-lived
 *      branch is STALE (reports 17 files, 3 of them real `.mjs` changes that landed on `main` independently
 *      while the branch sat open, vs. the 4-file all-markdown TRUE diff `git show` proves), so this
 *      changed-file check alone cannot exclude it. Filter 6 below closes that gap.
 *   5. (#3473) "does not resolve #NNN" BODY DISCLAIMER, scoped to THIS `num` (unlike the sibling
 *      `deliveredItemNumsFromPr` in `we:scripts/lib/open-pr-items.mjs`, which must extract potentially-multiple
 *      candidate ids before it can scope the disclaimer, this function already knows the single id it is
 *      checking, so the regex is built with `num` inline). Targets the same false-positive CLASS as filter 4
 *      (a PR that name-matches the item without actually implementing it) via the author's own words rather
 *      than a file-shape heuristic, for the case no file-shape check can catch (a real code PR that explicitly
 *      says it only lands a partial increment — see `deliveredItemNumsFromPr`'s guard 6 docblock for the
 *      `#3443`/PR #1866 case this mirrors).
 *   6. (#3473, added during this item's own post-fix verification) "no code changes" BLANKET BODY DISCLAIMER
 *      — closes the PR #1599 gap filter 4 leaves open: its stale `gh` `files` field defeats filter 4, but its
 *      own body still opens with a blanket claim ("No code behaviour changes — this is a backlog
 *      reconciliation plus one in-code comment repoint"), the same shape PR #1613's body uses ("No code
 *      changes — two backlog files."). A body matching `/\bno\s+code\s+(behaviou?r\s+)?changes?\b/i` excludes
 *      the PR outright, independent of (and a backstop for) filter 4's changed-file check.
 * NOTE: {@link filterAlreadyDoneCandidates} is a SIBLING implementation of `deliveredItemNumsFromPr`
 * (`we:scripts/lib/open-pr-items.mjs`) — no shared code, no import between the two files — because this one
 * feeds a dispatch-time HOLD (recoverable false positive) while that one feeds an auto-committed `status:
 * resolved` RESOLVE (unrecoverable false positive); #3473 widened the fix to cover both call sites in one pass
 * since the root cause is the same shape: crediting a PR as "done" from title/ref pattern alone, with no
 * signal distinguishing a real implementation from backlog housekeeping.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES **NOT** CLOSE, stated rather than silently residual: a PR that is neither prepare-scope nor
 * prepare-decision but is ALSO not the item's real implementation — a backlog-only doc/evidence edit landed
 * under the item's own `lane/<NUM>-<slug>` ref (e.g. `#1848`, "backlog/3435: add evidence section…", merged
 * hours before the real `#1861` implementation) — still passes every filter here and would read as "done". Two
 * things bound the blast radius of that residual: (a) both #3457/#3460 chokepoints only ever HOLD/REFUSE on a
 * match, never auto-resolve the item (see `shapeDispatchRead`'s new branch and `dispatch-plan.mjs`'s
 * `already-done` hold) — a false hold is recoverable (a human/agent looks, then dispatches by hand), where a
 * false auto-resolve would not be; (b) narrowing further (e.g. requiring the PR's own diff to have flipped

/**
 * THE ALREADY-DONE GROUND-TRUTH CHECK (#3457/#3460) — "does a real merged PR already close `num` out",
 * independent of and un-trusting of the item's own `status:` frontmatter (the whole gap this item fixes: a
 * merged PR that closes an item out is not guaranteed to have flipped that item's `status:` at the same time).
 *
 * QUERY SHAPE, chosen and reasoned about explicitly (left open by #3457's own ruling for this item to settle):
 * `gh pr list --search "<NNN> in:title" --state merged` — scoped to the PR TITLE, not `gh pr list --search
 * "<NNN>"` bare (full-text over title+body+comments). Measured live while authoring this check (2026-09-03):
 * a bare-text search for `"1861"` matched THREE PRs that never mention `1861` in their own title at all — one
 * (`#1864`) only because its BODY happens to say "open PR #1861 already in flight" while describing a
 * DIFFERENT item (`#3435`) in passing. `in:title` alone already eliminates that class of false positive; this
 * repo's own convention (`we:AGENTS.md`'s commit style, confirmed via `git log`) titles every implementing PR
 * `WE #NNN: …` or `(#NNN)`, so title-scoping loses no real signal.
 *
 * FAIL-SOFT ON A `gh` FAILURE, matching {@link createDispatchObservers}'s own PR axis and the lease reaper's
 * `fetchPrStates` ("any gh failure disables the axis"): a wedged/unauthenticated/rate-limited `gh` degrades this
 * check to "nothing found" rather than blocking or crashing a dispatch read that has nothing to do with GitHub
 * auth. `checked: false` on the result says the read itself failed (never asserted as "confirmed not done") —
 * the same shape distinction {@link defaultCheckAlreadyDone}'s caller relies on.
 *
 * @param {string|number} num - the item id.
 * @param {{exec?: Function, env?: object}} [io] - injected ONLY so the argv/opts are assertable in a test.
 * @returns {{done: boolean, pr: object|null, checked: boolean}}

/**
 * THE CONCURRENT SIBLING OF {@link defaultCheckAlreadyDone} — same query shape, same matcher, but via
 * `execFile` (promise-based) instead of `execFileSync`, so a caller checking MANY ids in one tick can run
 * them concurrently instead of paying each `gh` round-trip serially.
 *
 * @test-only-export-ok: consumed only via `dispatch-plan.mjs`'s dynamic `await import(...)` (a lazy IO-shell
 *   import, not a static one), which the test-only-export scan cannot trace.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS (measured live, 2026-09-04): `dispatch-plan.mjs`'s already-done pass calls
 * {@link defaultCheckAlreadyDone} once per age-gated stale item, in a plain `for` loop — with the queue at
 * 69 entries, most past the 2h age gate, that is up to ~69 sequential `gh pr list` round-trips, observed to
 * push one `dispatch-plan.mjs --json` run past 60s (and `tick-core.mjs`'s own wrapping call has no timeout
 * at all — see its `runJson`). The conveyor runner ticks on a ~120s clock, so a single slow tick can eat the
 * whole budget and the next tick's dispatch reads stale-by-then state. The check itself (one `gh` call per
 * id) is unavoidable — there is no bulk "is any of these NNN already merged" query `gh pr list --search`
 * supports — but nothing requires those calls to be SEQUENTIAL, and unlike `execFileSync`, `execFile` does
 * not block the event loop, so many can be in flight at once.
 *
 * SAME fail-soft contract as the sync version: any `gh` failure (auth, rate-limit, timeout) resolves to
 * `{ done: false, pr: null, checked: false }` rather than rejecting — a caller `Promise.all`-ing many of
 * these must never have one bad id fail the whole batch.
 *
 * @param {string|number} num - the item id.
 * @param {{execFileFn?: Function, env?: object}} [io] - `execFileFn` injected ONLY so the argv/opts are
 *   assertable in a test; defaults to the promisified `node:child_process` `execFile`.
 * @returns {Promise<{done: boolean, pr: object|null, checked: boolean}>}

 * an observer worse than none.
 *
 * `all: true` IS AN OPT-IN, not a second default. It exists for a caller with the opposite job to the
 * observer's — one that must see COMPLETED sessions to do anything at all (`scripts/conveyor/session-reaper.mjs`,
 * #3435 review: the reaper's whole purpose is to find and `claude stop` `done`/`failed` sessions, which the
 * non-`--all` listing excludes entirely — so the plain default silently reaped nothing, ever). Every OTHER
 * caller passes no `all`, so its argv is byte-identical to before this option existed.
 *
 * BOUNDED, because this call sits synchronously inside a waker pass that promises to be fail-soft per run: a
 * `claude` that blocks (a cold start that wants to ask something, a wedged daemon) would otherwise stall every
 * OTHER parked run in the pass. A timeout turns that into one reported observer error, which is what the
 * contract says should happen.
 *
 * ASSERTED, not merely asserted-about. This function was called by no test at all, so both of the emphatic
 * claims above it — no `--all`, and a timeout — could be inverted with the suite green (PR #1211 review, F5/F6).
 * `dispatch-lane-defaults.test.mjs` now pins the argv and the opts, and the wake CLI test proves the same argv
 * across a real process boundary. `session-reaper-cli.test.mjs` pins the OPT-IN side the same way (#3435).

 * @param {{exec?: Function, env?: object, all?: boolean}} [io] - injected ONLY so the argv and opts can be
