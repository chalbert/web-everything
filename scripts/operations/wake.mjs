/**
 * @file scripts/operations/wake.mjs
 * @description THE WAKER — one pass over every parked run (#x0t9923, ruled by #3070).
 *
 * A suspended run resumes only when someone calls `advance`, and it cannot be the session that dispatched the
 * work: that session is gone. #3070 ruled the host — a dedicated interval job that calls `advance` and nothing
 * else, the converge daemon's SHAPE rather than the converge daemon, awake-only accepted. This is that job's
 * body; scheduling it is the operator's `StartInterval`, not this file's business.
 *
 * ONE PASS, AND IT IS SAFE TO RUN AS OFTEN AS YOU LIKE. `advance`'s no-resume path returns the run unchanged,
 * so polling changes nothing until the work is actually done. That is why #3070 could rule on WHO owns the
 * schedule without costing anything: the frequency is free, the coupling was the whole question.
 *
 * WHAT ONE PASS DOES, per run:
 *   1. read it; skip anything not parked on an in-flight effect;
 *   2. ask the registered observer about each OBSERVABLE in-flight entry (`observeRun`);
 *   3. write the record back if anything resolved — before advancing, so a crash here loses no answer;
 *   4. `advance` while it makes progress, applying any effects the run reaches.
 *
 * FAIL-SOFT PER RUN, ON PURPOSE. A pass touches every parked run in the store, so one unreadable record, one
 * missing observer or one throwing observer must not stop the others — each is collected into the report and
 * the pass continues. The alternative is a waker that stops waking everything the first time one run is odd,
 * which is worse than a waker that reports and carries on.
 *
 * THE TABLE IS INJECTED, exactly like the executor's sinks — this module knows nothing about what any handle
 * means. The CLI block at the bottom registers the ONE observer that exists today, the `claude agents`-backed
 * one that `dispatch-lane` (#3037) dispatches against; before it there was nothing in the repo to watch.
 *
 * IO: reads and writes run records through an INJECTED store, and calls INJECTED observers and sinks. The CLI
 * block at the bottom is the only part that touches the real ones.

/**
 * CLOSE ONE IN-FLIGHT ENTRY OUT — the CLI surface `resolveInFlight` never had (PR #1211 review, F1).
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES HERE. The waker is the process that discovers a stuck entry and the only thing that prints its
 * key, so it is where the operator already is when they need to act. Until now the answer printed by
 * `renderPass` was "no CLI surface yet, so a short script" — and for `dispatch-lane` that mattered more than it
 * looked: its observer could not answer `succeeded` at all (`claude agents` reports liveness, not outcome), so
 * EVERY completed dispatch needed a person, and "write some node" once per build is not a remedy.
 *
 * IT IS NO LONGER THE ONLY WAY OUT, AND IS UNCHANGED BY THAT (#x9ylkp7). The observer now also reads the
 * entry's PR and resolves a MERGED one on its own, so the clean case closes itself. This surface stays exactly
 * as it was, because the cases it exists for are the ones the machine still cannot rule on: a PR that was
 * closed unmerged, one parked mid-review, a build that never opened one at all, and a match that can only be
 * attributed to an earlier attempt. The two paths coexist and neither needs the other.
 *
 * IT OWNS EXACTLY ONE RULE, AND `resolveInFlight` OWNS EVERY OTHER. The status rules — terminal only,
 * `in-flight` only, no rewriting a settled entry — are `resolveInFlight`'s and are called first, so a malformed
 * close-out is refused before anything else happens. The one rule that lives HERE is liveness, because it is
 * the one `resolveInFlight` structurally cannot know: see {@link assertHandleNotLive}.

 * a five-minute-old, still-live dispatch un-parked the run; `failed` is retried by the executor with no cap;
