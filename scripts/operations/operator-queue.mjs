/**
 * @file Read-only operator queue: the SOLE authority on which human-gated PRs are worth the operator's time.
 *
 * THE OPERATOR'S RULE (2026-09-19): "I won't look at a human PR until it carries `advisory:accepted` and has no
 * request-changes or review-pending." A PR is in NEEDS YOU only when ALL of these hold:
 *   - it carries `review:human` AND `advisory:accepted`, and carries NEITHER `review:pending` NOR `review:changes`
 *     (a HARD gate on the labels — `review:pending` is by definition not ready);
 *   - the advisory COMMENT, parsed independently (`we:scripts/lib/advisory-labels.mjs#parseAdvisories`), agrees:
 *     its newest advisory covers the live head and accepts. The comment is the source of truth; the label is a
 *     derived view of it. Any disagreement between the two is reported in NOT READY as the reason, never resolved
 *     silently in either direction;
 *   - CI is green, the PR is not conflicting, and GitHub reports it MERGEABLE.
 *
 * THREE BUCKETS, not two. `mergeable: UNKNOWN` is GitHub's transient "still computing" state, and reporting it in
 * NOT READY ("agent work is owed") made a healthy PR flap between ready and not-ready from run to run. So an
 * UNKNOWN PR is re-polled a few times with backoff (GitHub computes on request); one that is STILL unknown lands in
 * PENDING — "transient, re-run", where no agent work is owed. A PR with a real failure stays in NOT READY and does
 * not list the transient state among its reasons.
 *
 * A FIFTH SECTION, STOOD DOWN, ORTHOGONAL TO ALL OF THE ABOVE (we:backlog/x6cjgz5). A conveyor stand-down comment
 * (`we:scripts/conveyor/stand-down.mjs`) is posted whenever a fix agent stops to ask for human judgment, and BY
 * DESIGN it changes no label — `review:human` stays whatever it already was, which for most stood-down PRs is
 * nothing at all. So a stood-down PR without `review:human` was in nobody's queue (live: PR #2505 sat stood down
 * and invisible). This section lists every OPEN PR carrying at least one stand-down comment, regardless of its
 * labels, reusing `countStandDownComments`/`STAND_DOWN_MARKER` rather than re-deriving the match rule — and never
 * duplicates a PR already shown in NEEDS YOU.
