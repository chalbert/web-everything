/**
 * @file scripts/operations/heavy-queue-io.mjs
 * @description Card xb0iuxq (epic #4075, under #3383) — the IO shell for the `heavy-queue` operation. Every
 *   real read lives here, injectable exactly like `daemon-status-io.mjs`'s own shape:
 *
 *   1. `we:scripts/readiness/heavy-admission.mjs`'s own `admissionStatus` EXPORT — the module's exports, never a
 *      subprocess, per the card. That module already IS the single source of truth for who holds/waits on the
 *      pool; this file adds no second read of its lock files.
 *   2. `readLaneLease` (also re-exported by `heavy-admission.mjs`, not reimplemented) for each holder/waiter's
 *      OWN lane clone — the lease's `purpose`/`session` is the WHO the card asks for (e.g. `fix-2672`,
 *      `ci-heal-2636`, or a bare chat-session slug when no purpose was set).
 *   3. `ps -o command= -p <pid>` — the ONE new real read this operation needs, since neither a held slot's lock
 *      entry nor a waiting marker stores the command it is running/about to run (see `heavy-queue.mjs`'s own
 *      header for why the live pid's argv is the more truthful source anyway).
 *   4. `git -C <repo> merge-base --is-ancestor <sha> HEAD` — whether a repo's checked-out history already
 *      contains PR #2680 (the diff-driven default-gate cutover), memoized per repo path within one collection
 *      pass (several rows commonly share one repo).
 *
 * A repo that no longer exists, or a pid that has already exited, degrades to `null`/`false` rather than
 * throwing — a heavy-command holder/waiter can legitimately finish between the admission read and this
 * follow-up read, and a stale row should read as "unknown", never crash the whole report.

 *
 *  SECURITY (#2692 independent review): argv is where credentials live on a dev host (`--token=…`, `curl -H

 *  is registered under — with no redaction step downstream of this function. `redactCommandLine` (the SAME
 *  gate `host-process-sample.mjs`'s telemetry already applies to this exact data class, #3383
 *  telemetry-granularity) is therefore applied HERE, at the one choke point every command string passes
 *  through, so a raw, unredacted command line is never even constructed — every caller downstream (the pure
