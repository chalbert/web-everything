/**
 * @file scripts/operations/dispatch-providers/prepare-decision.mjs
 * @description THE `prepare-decision` LAUNCH KIND'S MECHANICAL DISPATCH PROVIDER (#3644). Copied from
 *   {@link ./build.mjs}, the template the registry's own "REGISTERING A NEW KIND" section points every sibling
 *   kind at — same port, same detached primitives, same durable handle shape.
 *
 * ── THE PORT CONTRACT THIS FILE IMPLEMENTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *     (request, io) => 'pid:<n>'
 *
 * `request` is the `#3579` dispatch port's request — `{ num, lane, scope, sessionSlug, launchKind, prompt,
 * cwd, ... }`, assembled by {@link ../dispatch-lane-io.mjs#createDispatchSinks} from the effect payload. The
 * return value is a DURABLE HANDLE: a string a LATER, SEPARATE process — one that never parented the thing it
 * names — can resolve back to a live/gone answer. Here that is `pid:<n>`
 * ({@link ../detached-dispatch.mjs#DETACHED_HANDLE_PREFIX}), and the KERNEL answers it
 * ({@link ../detached-dispatch.mjs#defaultIsPidAlive}). Durability is the whole contract: the run store
 * persists the handle, and the double-dispatch guard is only as good as a RESTARTED runner's ability to ask
 * about it — which is this item's own acceptance clause, not a nicety.
 *
 * NO `process.env` READ ANYWHERE IN THIS FILE, deliberately. The REGISTRY owns mode selection: the operator's
 * opt-out (`WE_PREPARE_DECISION_DISPATCH_MODE`) is DECLARED as this kind's `modeEnv` in
 * {@link ../dispatch-provider-registry.mjs} and resolved ONCE, at sink-construction time, by
 * `dispatchModesFromEnv`. A provider that read the environment itself would be a second, per-dispatch read of
 * the same knob — exactly the thing `dispatchModesFromEnv`'s docblock exists to prevent (one tick must not be
 * able to straddle two modes), and it would make the registry's declaration a decoration rather than the
 * source of truth. By the time this function runs, the mode question is already settled.
 *
 * A PROVIDER REFUSES RATHER THAN GUESSES, in the two shapes {@link ./build.mjs} establishes: `notApplied`
 * (thrown BEFORE any process exists) lands the entry `failed` and it is retried; a plain `throw` after
 * something may have started lands it `in-flight` with a null handle, which is INDETERMINATE and visible under
 * `inFlightEntries().unknown`. Both appear below, and which is used where is the interesting part.

/**
 * THE `prepare-decision` PROVIDER (#3644) — one implementation of the SAME `#3579` port
 * `dispatch-lane-io.mjs#defaultClaudeProvider` implements, answering the same request with the same thing: a
 * durable handle for later liveness polling.
 *
 * ── WHY DETACHED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `we:scripts/operations/prepare-decision-wrapper.mjs#prepareDecision` blocks for up to an hour on its single
 * agent spawn and for minutes more on the gate and the converge loop, and the dispatch path it sits on is
 * `runner.mjs#makeCliDispatchPass`'s SYNCHRONOUS `execFileSync` of `run.mjs dispatch-lane --num=<N>`, once per
 * surfaced item, inside the resident runner's OWN TICK. Blocking there would starve every other item in the
 * tick, stop the singleton lease being heartbeated, and make `run.mjs restart-runner` kill a half-finished
 * prepare — a held decision, a lane lease nobody owns, no PR, and a decision left half-authored.
 *
 * So the wrapper runs in its own process ({@link PREPARE_DECISION_RUN_SCRIPT}), detached and unref'd, and this
 * provider returns in milliseconds exactly as the `claude --bg` path did. THE DISPATCH SINK'S CONTRACT IS
 * UNCHANGED: same `inFlight({handle, expectedBy})`, same run-store record, same observer. The only difference
 * is the handle's SHAPE (`pid:<n>`) and therefore which question answers its liveness — `isDispatchHandleLive`
 * owns that, and both readers go through it.
 *
 * WHAT A KILLED SINK STILL COSTS, stated rather than papered over: exactly what it cost before. `dispatch:
 * true` means the executor writes `in-flight` BEFORE this runs (#3073), so a sink killed between `spawn`
 * returning and this function returning leaves an entry with a null handle in `inFlightEntries().unknown` —
 * visible, and closable with `resolveInFlight`.
 *
 * @param {{sessionSlug?: string, num?: string|number, lane?: string|number, scope?: string, cwd?: string}} request
 * @param {{spawnDetached?: Function, logPathFor?: Function, attemptTagFor?: Function, runScript?: string}} [io]
 * @returns {string} the `pid:<n>` handle.
