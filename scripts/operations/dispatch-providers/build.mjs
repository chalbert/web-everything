 * @description THE `build` LAUNCH KIND'S MECHANICAL DISPATCH PROVIDER (#3645) — and THE TEMPLATE every sibling
 *   kind copies. Moved here VERBATIM from {@link ../dispatch-lane-io.mjs}; not one line of its behaviour
 *   changed in the move.
 *
 * ── THE PORT CONTRACT THIS FILE IMPLEMENTS ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *     (request, io?) => string
 *
 * `request` is the `#3579` dispatch port's request — `{ num, lane, scope, sessionSlug, launchKind, prompt,
 * cwd, ... }`, assembled by {@link ../dispatch-lane-io.mjs#createDispatchSinks} from the effect payload. The
 * return value is a DURABLE HANDLE: a string that a LATER, SEPARATE process — one that never parented the
 * thing it names — can resolve back to a live/gone answer. For every detached provider that handle is
 * `pid:<n>` ({@link ../detached-dispatch.mjs#DETACHED_HANDLE_PREFIX}) and the kernel answers it
 * ({@link ../detached-dispatch.mjs#defaultIsPidAlive}). Durability is the whole contract: the run store
 * persists the handle, and the double-dispatch guard is only as good as a restarted runner's ability to ask
 * about it. Returning a handle that only the dispatching process could have resolved is the one way to break
 * this port while passing every local test.
 *
 * A provider REFUSES rather than guesses. `notApplied` (thrown before any process exists) lands the entry
 * `failed` and it is retried; a plain `throw` after something may have started lands it `in-flight` with a
 * null handle, which is INDETERMINATE and visible under `inFlightEntries().unknown`. Both shapes are used
 * below, and which one is used where is the interesting part of the code.
 *
 * ── REGISTERING A NEW KIND: COPY THIS FILE ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * A sibling kind (`prepare` #3641, `prepare-decision` #3644, `fix` #3640, `ci-heal` #3642) is a new
 * `we:scripts/operations/dispatch-providers/<kind>.mjs` shaped exactly like this one: it imports its
 * primitives from {@link ../detached-dispatch.mjs}, validates the fields its own wrapper needs, builds its
 * argv, spawns detached, and returns the `pid:<n>` handle. Then ONE entry in
 * {@link ../dispatch-provider-registry.mjs}. Nothing in {@link ../dispatch-lane-io.mjs} is touched — which is
 * the point of the registry, because five lanes each adding an `if (kind === ...)` arm to one router all
 * collide on the same handful of lines.

/**
 * THE `build` PROVIDER (`#3645`) — one implementation of the SAME `#3579` port {@link defaultClaudeProvider}
 * implements, answering the same request shape with the same thing: a durable handle for later liveness polling.
 *
 * ── WHY DETACHED, WHERE THE REVIEW WRAPPER IS NOT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `review-dispatch.mjs` could call its wrapper INLINE and simply block, because its caller
 * (`we:skills-src/conveyor/runner.mjs`'s review-reconcile pass) was moved onto the heartbeating async spawner in
 * the same change. A BUILD cannot take that trade. `deliverItem`'s single `provider.spawn` is budgeted at 60
 * minutes (`deliver-item-wrapper.mjs#DELIVERY_AGENT_SPAWN_TIMEOUT_MS`) and the gate + converge that follow add
 * more; the dispatch path it sits on is `makeCliDispatchPass`'s SYNCHRONOUS `execFileSync` of
 * `run.mjs dispatch-lane --num=<N>`, once per surfaced item, inside the runner's own tick. Blocking there would
 * starve every other item in the tick, stop the singleton lease being heartbeated, and — the acceptance
 * criterion this item was filed with — make a `restart-runner` kill a half-finished build: a claimed item, a
 * held lane, no PR, no record of how far it got.
 *
 * So the wrapper runs in its OWN process ({@link DELIVER_ITEM_RUN_SCRIPT}), detached and unref'd, and this
 * provider returns in milliseconds exactly as the `claude --bg` path did. THE DISPATCH SINK'S CONTRACT IS
 * UNCHANGED: same `inFlight({handle, expectedBy})`, same run-store record, same observer. The only difference is
 * the handle's SHAPE (`pid:<n>`, see {@link DETACHED_HANDLE_PREFIX}) and therefore which question answers its
 * liveness — {@link isDispatchHandleLive} owns that, and both readers go through it.
 *
 * WHAT A KILLED SINK STILL COSTS, stated rather than papered over: exactly what it cost before. `dispatch: true`
 * means the executor writes `in-flight` BEFORE this runs (#3073), so a sink killed between `spawn` returning and
 * this function returning leaves an entry with a null handle in `inFlightEntries().unknown` — visible, and
 * closable with `resolveInFlight`. That window is not widened here; it is, if anything, shorter, because there
 * is no CLI confirmation line to parse before the handle is known.
 *
 * @param {{sessionSlug?: string, num?: string|number, lane?: string|number, scope?: string, cwd?: string}} request
 * @param {{spawnDetached?: Function, logPathFor?: Function, attemptTagFor?: Function,
 *   readDeliveryAgentMarker?: Function}} [io]
 * @returns {string} the `pid:<n>` handle.
