/**
 * @file scripts/operations/dispatch-providers/prepare.mjs
 * @description `#3641` — THE `prepare` LAUNCH KIND'S DISPATCH PROVIDER. One implementation of the same `#3579`
 * provider port `defaultClaudeProvider` implements, answering the same request with the same thing: a durable
 * handle for later liveness polling.
 *
 * Instead of handing a `claude --bg` agent the 242-line `we:skills-src/conveyor/prepare-scope-agent-brief.md`
 * and trusting it to run its own lifecycle (lane-pool acquire, verify-lane request/poll, its own adversarial
 * review subagent, `git commit`, `open-pr`, `learnings-drop`), a prepare dispatch now starts
 * `we:scripts/operations/prepare-scope-run.mjs`, which runs
 * `we:scripts/operations/prepare-scope-wrapper.mjs#prepareScope` — acquire → spawn ONE minimal agent that does
 * only the judgment (predict the touch-set, write `scope:`) → gate (one retry) → check it touched only its own
 * backlog file → commit → open PR → drop learning — mechanically.
 *
 * ── WHY DETACHED ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `#3641`'s own second acceptance clause, and the parent epic `#3383`'s cross-cutting one. `prepareScope`
 * blocks for tens of minutes (one agent turn + a 150-350s gate + `open-pr --mode=label-on-green` waiting on a
 * required check), and the dispatch path it sits on is `we:skills-src/conveyor/runner.mjs`'s
 * `makeCliDispatchPass` — a SYNCHRONOUS `execFileSync` of `run.mjs dispatch-lane --num=<N>` inside the resident
 * runner's own tick. Blocking there would starve the rest of the tick, stop the singleton lease being
 * heartbeated, and make a `run.mjs restart-runner` kill a half-finished prepare: a held lane, an uncommitted
 * `scope:` edit, no PR.
 *
 * So the wrapper runs in its OWN process ({@link PREPARE_SCOPE_RUN_SCRIPT}), detached and unref'd, and this
 * provider returns in milliseconds exactly as the `claude --bg` path did. THE DISPATCH SINK'S CONTRACT IS
 * UNCHANGED: same `inFlight({handle, expectedBy})`, same run-store record, same observer. The only difference
 * is the handle's SHAPE (`pid:<n>`) and therefore which question answers its liveness — `isDispatchHandleLive`
 * owns that, and every reader goes through it.
 *
 * NO `--attempt` FLAG, unlike the `build` provider: a prepare has no retry-attempt letter
 * (`dispatch-lane.mjs#readTick` — "only a fresh `build` dispatch mints a retry-attempt letter"), so passing one
 * would invent a field the dispatcher never emits. Its session slug is `prepare-<num>` on every attempt, which
 * is exactly why `prepareScope` deletes any stale report for that slug before it spawns anything.
