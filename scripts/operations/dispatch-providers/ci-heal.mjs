/**
 * @file scripts/operations/dispatch-providers/ci-heal.mjs
 * @description THE `ci-heal` LAUNCH KIND'S MECHANICAL DISPATCH PROVIDER (#3642) — copied from
 *   {@link ./fix.mjs}, NOT from {@link ./build.mjs}, because `ci-heal` is the OTHER PR-keyed repair kind:
 *   same `pr`/`sessionSlug` required fields, same no-lane-number shape, same no-attempt-tag shape. That file
 *   names this one as its copier and lists exactly what must change; this is that change.
 *
 * ── THE PORT CONTRACT ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *     (request, io?) => 'pid:<n>'
 *
 * Identical to `fix`'s and `build`'s, and read from {@link ./build.mjs}'s own docblock rather than restated:
 * `request` is the `#3579` dispatch port's request assembled by `../dispatch-lane-io.mjs#createDispatchSinks`,
 * and the return value is a DURABLE handle a LATER, SEPARATE process — one that never parented the thing it
 * names — can resolve back to live/gone. The kernel answers it
 * ({@link ../detached-dispatch.mjs#defaultIsPidAlive}), which is what makes a restarted runner's
 * double-dispatch guard hold.
 *
 * NO `process.env` READ ANYWHERE IN HERE. Whether this provider runs at all is the REGISTRY's decision
 * (`WE_CI_HEAL_DISPATCH_MODE`, resolved once at sink-construction time by
 * `../dispatch-provider-registry.mjs#dispatchModesFromEnv`); a provider that re-read the environment could
 * disagree with the router that chose it, inside one tick.
 *
 * ── THE ONE THING THIS FORWARDS THAT `fix` DOES NOT ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * `--reason`. `dispatch-lane.mjs#BRIEF_REQUIRED_BY_KIND['ci-heal']` is the only kind whose brief requires a
 * `REASON` (`red-ci` — a required check went red after open — or `behind` — BEHIND `main` and parked), and
 * the durable comment the wrapper posts branches on it
 * (`we:scripts/conveyor/ci-heal-mark.mjs#buildCiHealComment`). It is ALREADY on the port request: #3640
 * forwarded `pr` AND `reason` onto it together, specifically so this item would add a registry ROW and a
 * provider and change nothing in the io shell. Passed only when there is one, rather than as an empty flag
 * the wrapper would have to re-normalise — the same rule `fix.mjs` applies to its optional `--num`.
 *
 * Everything else is `fix.mjs`'s, unchanged: `pr` and `sessionSlug` are refused when absent (a repair targets
 * an existing PR and keys its report by slug), the planned LANE NUMBER is deliberately NOT forwarded (the
 * wrapper acquires its own lane through the UNNUMBERED `lane-pool.mjs acquire --base=<the PR's headRefName>`
 * path, so a pre-assigned number is one it cannot honour — `we:backlog/3542-*.md` tracks the tick-side half),
 * and there is NO attempt tag (`dispatch-lane.mjs#attemptTagFor` is called under `launchKind === 'build'`
 * only, because a repair reconstitutes the SAME ref every attempt).
