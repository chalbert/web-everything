/**
 * @file scripts/operations/review-prep.mjs
 * @description THE `review-prep` DECLARATION — mechanizing the independent-review-of-preparation pattern
 *   (backlog/xzdi27a-*, under epic #3099), the sibling of `we:scripts/operations/review-pr.mjs` (#3035) for a
 *   BACKLOG CARD instead of a PR diff.
 *
 * ONE DECLARATION, DERIVED CALLERS. Per the statute
 * [#operations-declared-once-callers-generated](../../docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#operations-declared-once-callers-generated)
 * (#3031), the operation is declared HERE, once; {@link ./run.mjs} registers it in the CLI's operation table
 * and every flag/usage line is DERIVED from the declaration by {@link ./cli-adapter.mjs} — see that file for
 * why a second, hand-written CLI is the exact defect the statute forbids.
 *
 * ── WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE OPERATION, NOT A TARGET-TYPE FLAG ON `review-pr` (the card's decided fork) ────────
 *
 * `review-pr`'s `read` and `record` are PR-shaped all the way down: `read` composes `assembleReviewDetail` +
 * the NET-diff basis (a card has no diff), and `record` composes `decideSetLabel` + a GitHub label swap (a
 * card has no label — its "verdict" is a review NOTE appended to the file and a commit, the pattern all ten
 * hand-rolled reviews that motivated this operation used). Branching those two steps on a target-type flag
 * would put an if/else through the exact place #3031's statute says stays declared-once-per-shape.
 *
 * ── WHAT DOES COMPOSE, AND AT THE RIGHT SEAM (independent review, 2026-08-14, corrected the card's original
 *    text) ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * The juror-spawn machinery (`we:scripts/lib/judge-spawn.mjs`) and #3094's mandate INGREDIENTS are
 * target-agnostic; `buildPanelMandate` (`review-pr.mjs`'s import) is NOT — it is a declared member of
 * `PR_DIFF_ADAPTER`, review-core's own doc calls it "the diff-specific mandate framing", and its output states
 * things that are false of a card ("You see ONLY the diff", a PR-vs-main ground-truth block). The seam this
 * repo already built for exactly this (#2656; `DECISION_PROSE_ADAPTER` and `DESIGN_PIXELS_ADAPTER` are shipped
 * precedents) is `buildSubjectMandate` (`we:scripts/lib/jury-core.mjs`) plus the EXPORTED rule constants —
 * `MUTATION_PROBE_RULE` (unconditional, per the #3094 fork ruling) and `FENCED_DATA_RULE`/`fenceUntrusted` for
 * caller-supplied prose (here: the card's own body, quoted verbatim so the juror can re-verify its claims
 * against live code). {@link buildPrepMandate} below is this operation's adapter over that skeleton — built the
 * same way `buildPanelMandate` is built over it (call the skeleton for the base, then push subject-specific
 * parts, checking for an already-present `FENCED_DATA_RULE` before adding a second copy), with the rule
 * constants ASSERTED VERBATIM via import, never paraphrased (`__tests__/review-prep.test.mjs` pins this with
 * `toContain` on the import).
 *
 * ── THE FOUR STEPS, NO `confirm` (deliberately, per the card) ──────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 *   | step     | kind      | the implementation behind it                                                       |
 *   |----------|-----------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
 *   | `read`   | `compute` | `readPrep` (`we:scripts/operations/review-prep-io.mjs`) — frontmatter + body + scope |
 *   | `judge`  | `judge`   | `buildPrepMandate` (below), on `buildSubjectMandate` — DECLARED, never spawned here   |
 *   | `reduce` | `compute` | pulls `confidence` + named `risks` + `corrections` DIRECTLY off the juror's answer    |
 *   | `record` | `effect`  | `recordPrepVerdict` (`review-prep-io.mjs`) — append, commit, land or park             |
 *
 * NO `confirm` STEP. A prep review's verdict is a note + a commit, not a GitHub label a human gate-self path
 * cares about — if a human stop turns out to be needed once this is used for real, that is its own item,
 * decided from real use, not guessed in here. Because there is no human to ask, the `record` step's mutating
 * effect carries its OWN deterministic abstention instead (the content-hash race guard — see
 * `review-prep-io.mjs`'s header) rather than a question nobody can answer.
 *
 * PURE apart from the injected `readPrep`: no fs, no clock, no process, no network in this file.
