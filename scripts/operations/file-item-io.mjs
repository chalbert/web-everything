/**
 * @file scripts/operations/file-item-io.mjs
 * @description THE IO SHELL of the `file-item` declaration — reuses `we:scripts/operations/scaffold-io.mjs`'s
 *   reader and write sink verbatim, and adds the one new sink `file-item.mjs` declares: clearing the freshly
 *   scaffolded card for the conveyor via `we:scripts/conveyor/queue-store.mjs`'s pure core.
 *
 * THE QUEUE SINK REACHES `queue-store.mjs` DIRECTLY, never `queue.mjs` as a subprocess — same shape as every
 * other operation's io shell (`dispatch-lane-io.mjs` reaches the conveyor's own modules directly rather than
 * shelling a CLI). `queue-store.mjs`'s own header says its sidecar path resolves by SCRIPT LOCATION, never
 * cwd, specifically so "the writer and readers can never diverge" — importing it here inherits that property
 * for free; a subprocess shell-out would not.
 *
 * WHERE THE QUEUE LIVES (decouple-primary-checkout, epic #4075). This sink used to resolve the LIVE runner's
 *   checkout (`resolve-runner-checkout.mjs`, `we:backlog/xtwondy-*`) and write THAT checkout's
 *   `.conveyor/queue.json`, because the queue was per-checkout and a card filed from a lane landed in a sidecar
 *   the runner never read. The queue is now ONE machine-wide file in the automation's state home
 *   (`queue-store.mjs#resolveQueuePath`) that every runner and daemon reads whichever checkout it runs from, so
 *   the default path is simply that file — the runner-resolution step (and its `lsof`/`ps` shell-outs) is gone.
 *   The "one effect or zero, never refused" invariant (`we:scripts/operations/file-item.mjs#planQueueing`) holds
 *   unchanged.
 *
 * IMPURE by construction: `fs`.
