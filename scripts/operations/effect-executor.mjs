 * @file scripts/operations/effect-executor.mjs
 * @description THE EFFECT EXECUTOR — the only thing in the engine that touches the world (#3032, epic #3029).
 *
 * An `effect` step DECLARES effects; this applies them, **keyed by run + step + ordinal**, so re-running
 * after a partial failure is safe and no caller has to hand-order two non-atomic writes. It is the
 * mechanism the statute (#operations-declared-once-callers-generated, #3031) says subsumes both the
 * *"a non-zero exit means re-run the same command"* instruction and the [#2964] write-ordering rule.
 *
 * HOW IT BEATS #2964, WHICH IS THE BAR. #2964 (resolved) is `runReviewLabelCli` splitting one logical act
 * across two `gh` calls with the UNSAFE half first: the label swap landed, then the comment carrying the
 * `reviewed-sha` marker failed, and `acceptanceCoversHead` fails OPEN on a missing marker. Its fix was to
 * REORDER the two calls by hand — the safe half first. This executor gives three guarantees, and the first
 * alone is what #2964 bought:
 *
 *   1. **Declared order is applied order.** Effects run strictly ascending by ordinal, `await`ed one at a
 *      time, and the executor HALTS at the first one that does not land. Effect N+1 is never attempted
 *      before N is `applied`. The declaration is therefore the ordering, in one readable place, instead of
 *      an ordering rule maintained by hand at every call site.
 *   2. **The half-done state is recoverable, not just avoided.** #2964's reordering still leaves the act
 *      half-done on a crash — it only chooses WHICH half. Here the run record remembers exactly which
 *      ordinals landed, so a replay finishes the act instead of restarting or abandoning it.
 *   3. **Replay never double-applies.** An `applied` entry is skipped, so the safe half is not re-posted
 *      while the unsafe half is retried.
 *
 * THE THIRD OUTCOME NOBODY WANTS TO WRITE DOWN: INDETERMINATE. A sink that throws may still have written.
 * So the executor marks an entry `pending` BEFORE calling the sink and only marks it `applied` after; an
 * entry left `pending` is an attempt whose outcome is unknown. On replay such an entry is:
 *   - **re-applied** when the effect declared `idempotent: true` (re-doing it is harmless by construction), or
 *   - **REFUSED** otherwise — the run stops and a person decides, which is the fail-closed answer. Guessing
 *     here is how you double-post a comment or double-merge a PR.
 * A sink that KNOWS nothing landed says so by throwing an error built with {@link notApplied}; that entry is
 * marked `failed` and is retried on the next pass.
 *
 * THE LEDGER SEAM — deliberately empty here. {@link LEDGER_EFFECT_TYPE} is the reserved effect type the
 * **verdict ledger** (#3007) lands behind: an append-only JSONL of review verdicts, keyed by repo + PR +
 * append order, which #3007 PHASE 1 now writes in SHADOW (labels are still what the drain merges on; Phase 2
 * flips the authority and is unbuilt). Two details this comment used to state are corrected in
 * `we:scripts/lib/verdict-ledger.mjs`'s header and were wrong: the records are NOT keyed on the diff
 * content-hash (that digest has two proven divergence defects, #3046 and `#3052`, open under `#3054`), and
 * the drain lease does NOT make the writers single — the ledger takes its own lock. This executor SHIPS NO
 * SINK FOR IT and owns no durable outcome store of its own — it only routes to a sink the caller registers.
 * That is the producer→store relationship: the run record is the transient working state, the ledger is the
 * durable authority, and #3032 must not invent a competitor to it (see the `run-record.mjs` header).
 *
 * IO: this file writes the run record through an INJECTED store handle and calls INJECTED sinks. It imports
 * no `fs` and no `child_process` itself, so the whole executor is testable with an in-memory store and stub
 * sinks — no process, no network.

/**
 * The marker a sink returns to say **"I started something that outlives this run"** (#3073).
 *
 * WHY A FOURTH STATE, AND WHY `applied` IS NOT IT. `applied` means the sink RAN, not that the work it started
 * FINISHED — and for every effect until now those were the same event. A dispatch breaks that: the sink starts
 * a build and returns in a second, so marking it `applied` records a completion that has not happened, and the
 * run advances past a step whose work is still going.
 *
 * WHY IT IS NOT `pending` EITHER, which is the confusion the #3030 spike named. `pending` means *attempted,
 * outcome UNKNOWN* — the process died mid-sink — and the replay guard rightly REFUSES a non-idempotent one
 * rather than risk a double-apply. In-flight means *started ON PURPOSE, outcome arrives later*, and refusing
 * it would be exactly wrong: it is the one state a replay is supposed to resume from. One status cannot mean
 * both without the guard being wrong half the time.
 *
 * THE DECLARATION SAYS SO FIRST. An effect opts in with `dispatch: true`, and the executor writes `in-flight`
 * BEFORE calling the sink.
 *
 * WHAT THAT ORDERING BUYS, and only for a PROCESS DEATH. It does NOT make a dispatch crash resumable: the
 * no-handle case below is REFUSED on replay, same as `pending`. What it buys is that a process killed between
 * starting the work and hearing back lands in a state a person can see and act on:
 *   - `inFlightEntries` reports it under `unknown` — "something may be running and cannot be observed" — where
 *     a `pending` entry says only "an attempt was made", losing the fact that work may still be out there.
 *   - `resolveInFlight` accepts it, so there is a supported way to close it out. `pending` has none, and the
 *     operator's only option is to hand-edit the run record.
 * Writing `in-flight` after the sink returned would put a process-killed dispatch back in `pending`, invisible
 * to both. A sink that THROWS is a different path and does not need the ordering — the catch branch below
 * records `in-flight` on its own.
 *
 * The sink then supplies what only it can know, by returning `inFlight({ handle, expectedBy })`:
 *   - `handle` is what a later observer polls. The spike established `sessionId` is durable and `pid` is NOT
 *     (the OS reuses it), so a handle must never be a pid.
 *   - `expectedBy` is an ISO timestamp — the earliest point at which "still running" becomes "probably dead".
 *     Without it a waker can tell finished from not-finished but not RUNNING from STALLED, which are the two
 *     that need opposite responses. Optional, because some work genuinely has no estimate; an entry without
 *     one is honestly unbounded rather than falsely bounded.
 *
 * AND A LOST HANDLE IS NOT "STILL RUNNING". Resumability rests entirely on being observable, so an in-flight
 * entry with no handle — the sink died before reporting one — has degraded back into "might have started,
 * cannot check", and {@link applyPendingEffects} refuses it exactly as it refuses an indeterminate `pending`.
 * {@link inFlightEntries} reports it under `unknown`, never `running`.

    // populations was filed wholly into whichever went last, carrying the other's attempts in its count.
    // Both directions corrupt the corpus:
    //   - human, human, then auto succeeds → filed as an automatic success at attempt 3. The truth is that
    //     exactly ONE automatic attempt was made and it worked first time. That is the pooled inflation this
    //     whole file exists to prevent.
    //   - auto, auto, then a human fixes the cause → filed as human, and TWO genuine automatic failures —

    // three real entry points — the CLI, the HTTP adapter and the waker — call `applyPendingEffects`
    // directly, so nothing in production ever had an argument eaten here. An earlier version of this
    // comment called it "the one production path that reaches applyPendingEffects", which was false and
    // was the same defect this item keeps bouncing on: a statement about one population (test callers)
    // used to describe another (production callers). The fix is still right — the façade is offered to
    // adapters and would mislabel the moment one used it, and mislabelled retry data cannot be recovered
    // — but it guards a surface nothing production reaches today.
