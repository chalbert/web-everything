/**
 * @file scripts/operations/run.mjs
 * @description THE OPERATION COMMAND LINE (#3035, under epic #3029) — `run.mjs <operation> [flags]`.
 *
 * THE WHOLE ENTRY POINT. There is no per-operation argv parser and no per-operation route: {@link
 * ./cli-adapter.mjs} derives both from the declaration, and this file only says WHICH operations exist and what
 * their io bindings are. Declaring a second operation adds one entry to {@link OPERATIONS} and buys its command
 * line; that is clause 1 of
 * [#operations-declared-once-callers-generated](../../docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#operations-declared-once-callers-generated)
 * in the smallest form it can take.
 *
 *   node scripts/operations/run.mjs review-pr --pr=1234 --repo=chalbert/web-everything --cwd=<a lane>
 *   node scripts/operations/run.mjs review-pr --resume=<run-id> --answer=accept
 *   node scripts/operations/run.mjs review-pr --resume=<run-id> --answer=abstain   # writes nothing
 *
 * The first invocation reads, judges, reduces and then STOPS at the `confirm` suspend. The second records. An
 * `--answer` on the first is refused — see the adapter's header.
 *
 * `--cwd=<a lane clone>` is the juror's own lane, and `review-pr`'s juror is TOOL-BEARING, so it is REQUIRED
 * there (`assertLaneCwd` refuses the spawn without one). It was `$JUDGE_LANE_CWD` and nothing else until #3151;
 * the env var still works as the fallback. `--cwd`, `--model` and the rest are listed by `--help`, which is
 * derived from the declaration — including which operations have a juror to point at a lane at all.
