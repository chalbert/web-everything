/**
 * @file scripts/operations/verify-io.mjs
 * @description THE IO SHELL of the `verify` declaration — it shells `we:scripts/verify-lane.mjs`, THE single
 *   home for running a lane's suites, and classifies what that home reported.
 *
 * IT SHELLS THE SINGLE HOME, AND THE FIRST CUT DID NOT — which is the reason this header leads with it. That
 * cut ran `npm run check:standards` and vitest directly and parsed their summary lines, i.e. it was a second
 * implementation of a step that already had an authority. Its own header forbade exactly that, and it did it
 * anyway, because nothing looked for the existing home first.
 *
 * The defect was not stylistic. `verify-lane.mjs` records a lifecycle MARKER keyed to HEAD (`running` →
 * `green`/`red`), and `pr-land`'s finish-guard refuses to land a lane whose marker is not green for the
 * current commit (#2833). A parallel runner that skipped the marker could therefore report `ok` on a lane
 * `pr-land` would then refuse — two answers to one question, drifting apart silently, which is the whole
 * reason #2644 makes these things singular.
 *
 * WHAT THIS ADDS, given the home already exists: a DECLARATION over it. The home speaks in exit codes and a
 * marker vocabulary (`green`, `red`, `running`, `corrupt`, `absent`, TTL-abandoned); a caller has to know all
 * of it to gate correctly, and every caller that learns it learns it separately. This maps that vocabulary
 * onto the three outcomes a caller actually acts on, ONCE:
 *
 *   · `green` for this HEAD                                   → `pass`
 *   · suites ran and failed (`red`, exit 2)                    → `fail`
 *   · anything that is not a completed verdict for this commit → `unrun`
 *
 * THAT LAST BUCKET IS THE POINT, and it is wider than "the runner crashed": a `corrupt` marker, a `running`
 * marker stranded by a killed process, a marker for a DIFFERENT commit, a usage/git error (exit 3), or output
 * that did not parse. None of those is a failure anybody observed, and none may satisfy a gate. #3203 was the
 * same shape one layer down — a killed juror and a crashed juror arrived identically, which taught the reader
 * to retry rather than look.
 *
 * `mode: 'check'` is the home's own read-only subcommand: read the marker, run nothing. It is what a board
 * polls; `run` is what a delivery agent calls once.

  //     the home apply its own default. Never restate that default here (#2644).
  //   • NEVER IN `check` MODE. `check` runs no suites at all — it reads the marker HEAD already carries and
  //     prints its verdict. A gate there would be an argument the home ignores, which reads to the next author
  //     as though the mode honoured it.
  //
  // Passed as ONE argv element, never shell-interpolated: the value is a full command line
  // (`npm run test:unit && npm run check:standards`), and `execFile` hands it to the home as a single
  // argument rather than letting `&&` reach a shell in this process.
