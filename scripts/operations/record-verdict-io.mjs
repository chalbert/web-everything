/**
 * @file scripts/operations/record-verdict-io.mjs
 * @description THE IO SHELL of the `record-verdict` declaration — read the run the review wrote, and stage the
 *   request the transport carries.
 *
 * EVERY RULE IT APPLIES BELONGS TO SOMEBODY ELSE, and that is deliberate:
 *   · the run record is read through `./run-store.mjs`, the store the engine writes;
 *   · the staged write-up is located with `./review-pr-io.mjs`'s own `reviewBodyPath`, so this cannot disagree
 *     with where the review put it — the run-scoped path exists because a PR-keyed one let two runs clobber
 *     each other, and re-deriving it here would reintroduce exactly that;
 *   · the request's legality is `we:scripts/apply-review-request.mjs`'s `validateRequest`, imported by the
 *     caller in `./run.mjs` and passed in, never restated.
 *
 * WHAT IS GENUINELY NEW HERE is only the push: writing the request onto the transport branch. Nothing owned
 * that before, because it was a shell one-liner each time.
 *
 * THE PUSH IS A SEPARATE CHECKOUT ON PURPOSE. `ops/review-requests` is an orphan-ish transport branch, and the
 * lane you are working in is on a feature branch with your own uncommitted work. Checking the transport branch
 * out over that lane would destroy it — I did the equivalent by hand earlier in the session and it disrupted a
 * running juror. So the sink writes through a dedicated worktree, leaving the caller's checkout untouched.
 *
 * ONBOARDING A REPO IS PART OF THE SINK'S JOB, not a paragraph someone has to find (#3264). Since #3261 each
 * repo owns its own board, so the common case is now a repo that has never carried a verdict. `ensureBoardBranch`
 * cuts the board from `main` on first use, `assertApplierRidesBoard` refuses a board that cannot apply, and
 * `trackingRefspec` names the destination ref so none of it depends on how the checkout was cloned.

 * Which checkout carries the transport branch for `repo`, and a REFUSAL when it is not this one (#3261).
 *
 * THE RULING: each repo owns its own notes. A verdict for `owner/x` is staged on `owner/x`'s OWN
 * `ops/review-requests` branch, applied by that repo's own workflow with its own repo-scoped token. Ruled on a
 * scaling test — at 100 repos a central board is not merely large, it is structurally wrong: every applier
 * would need cross-repo READ on a branch none of them owns.
 *
 * WHY THIS FUNCTION REFUSES RATHER THAN DEFAULTS. Before the ruling, a verdict for a sibling repo was pushed
 * onto THIS repo's branch and the applier failed with a raw `Could not resolve to a Repository` — the token is
 * repo-scoped (#3261's own evidence: one failure in fifty applier runs, and it was the only cross-repo
 * request). Defaulting to the local checkout would put a plateau-app verdict on web-everything's board again,
 * where the right applier will never see it and the wrong one cannot act on it. So a mismatch is an ERROR that
 * names both repos, never a silent push to the wrong board.
 *
 * `originRepo` is INJECTED so this is testable with no git, and so a caller that already knows the checkout
 * (the conveyor, a test) can say so instead of being probed.
 *
 * THE RULING IS BROADER THAN THIS ONE TRANSPORT, so the wording is parameterised (#xaoja7a). `stage-pr-view`
 * pushes a VIEW request to `ops/pr-views` and needs the identical decision — same repo-scoped token, same
 * stranding failure if it lands on the wrong board. Copying the function to say "a view request" instead of
 * "a verdict" would be a second answer to which board a repo's notes live on. The defaults reproduce
 * `record-verdict`'s own message byte for byte, so nothing that reads it changes.

/**
 * BOARD GENESIS: on a repo that has never carried a verdict, create `ops/review-requests` from `main` (#3264).
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS AT ALL. The sink used to fetch the board unconditionally, so the FIRST verdict for every
 * newly-onboarded repo failed on a raw `couldn't find remote ref`. #3261 made per-repo boards the standard,
 * which turned that from a one-time curiosity into the normal onboarding path — plateau-app hit it, and was
 * onboarded BY HAND with `git push origin origin/main:refs/heads/ops/review-requests`, a step that lived
 * nowhere but in a backlog paragraph. This is that step, made code.
 *
 * WHY FROM `main` AND NOT AN ORPHAN. See `APPLIER_WORKFLOW`: the workflow must ride the board or nothing
 * applies. Branching from `main` is what puts it there — and it also encodes the ordering the human had to
 * get right by judgement, since a board cut from a `main` predating the applier would silently apply nothing.
 * `assertApplierRidesBoard` catches that case rather than trusting the ordering.
 *
 * WHY IT PUSHES FROM `refs/remotes/origin/main` AND FETCHES IT FIRST. Same failure as (3) above, one ref over:
 * the remote-tracking ref for `main` is not guaranteed to exist in a narrow clone either, and pushing from the
 * LOCAL `main` would publish whatever that checkout happens to be sitting on — stale, or a lane. The remote tip
 * is the only honest source.
