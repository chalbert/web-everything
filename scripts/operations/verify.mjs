/**
 * @file scripts/operations/verify.mjs
 * @description THE `verify` DECLARATION (#xp240uk, under epic #3029) — did the repo's own checks pass in this
 *   checkout, and if not, what is blocking?
 *
 * IT DECLARES OVER AN EXISTING HOME, IT DOES NOT REPLACE ONE. `we:scripts/verify-lane.mjs` already runs a
 * lane's suites and records the HEAD-keyed marker `pr-land`'s finish-guard gates on (#2833). The first cut of
 * this operation ran the suites itself and skipped that marker, which would have let it report `ok` on a lane
 * `pr-land` then refused — two answers to one question. It now shells the home and classifies what the home
 * said.
 *
 * WHAT THE DECLARATION ADDS. The home speaks in exit codes and a marker vocabulary (`green`, `red`, `running`,
 * `corrupt`, `absent`, TTL-abandoned), and every caller that gates on it has to learn all of it separately.
 * This maps that vocabulary onto the three outcomes a caller acts on, once — and buys its command line and its
 * HTTP route from the same declaration. Per clause 1 of
 * [#operations-declared-once-callers-generated](../../docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#operations-declared-once-callers-generated)
 * that is a defect rather than a style choice.
 *
 * THE LOAD-BEARING DISTINCTION IS THREE-VALUED, not two. A check that PASSED, a check that FAILED, and a check
 * that COULD NOT RUN are three different facts, and the third is the one hand-rolled shell always loses: a
 * missing dependency, a crashed runner or a changed summary line exits non-zero with no parseable result, and
 * `|| true` or a `grep` that finds nothing turns it into whichever answer the caller's shell happened to
 * produce. #3203 was the same shape one layer down — a killed juror and a crashed juror arrived identically,
 * which taught the reader to retry rather than look. So `unrun` is a first-class outcome here, it is NEVER
 * folded into `fail`, and it never satisfies a gate.
 *
 * BOTH STEPS ARE `compute` AND THE DECLARATION HAS NO SINK. Verifying is a READ: it runs the repo's checks and
 * reports. Nothing it does may write, so `./http-adapter.mjs` derives a `GET`-only surface with no run record,
 * the same path `suggest-next` and `gate-health` already take. The subprocess work lives in
 * `./verify-io.mjs` and is injected, so every branch below is testable with no npm, no vitest and no clock.
 *
 * WHAT IT DELIBERATELY DOES NOT DO: decide whether the work is *good*. That is `review-pr`, which judges. This
 * only answers whether the repo's own machine-checkable gates are green, which is the precondition for asking
 * a juror anything at all.
