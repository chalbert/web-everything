/**
 * gate-config.mjs — the AUTO-REVIEW TRUST CHAIN as explicit, versioned config (#2448, under #2445).
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. The trust chain is the machinery whose edits are too sensitive to auto-clear. It has TWO
 * tiers (#2445 two-tier flip), and the POLICY tier is itself SPLIT IN TWO (#2771/#2785 — see below):
 *   • POLICY tier — the machinery that DEFINES whether the gate fires and what clears it (the rubric, the
 *     disposition router, this roster, the invariants). `isPolicyCorePath` / `isGateSelfPath` select this
 *     tier, and a member of it ALWAYS escalates. Whether it forces a HUMAN is the `leash` split below.
 *   • ENGINE tier — the lander, which OBEYS the gate but does not define it. A change here still ESCALATES
 *     and runs the full adversarial panel, but a converged agent verdict may clear it (agent-reviewable);
 *     the policy-tier invariant suite (human-only) is the backstop that catches a lander edit that tries to
 *     bypass a verdict. This is the deliberate relaxation that lets the delivery engine improve itself
 *     without a mandatory human on every lander patch, while the leash-defining tier stays human.
 * This file is the SINGLE SOURCE OF TRUTH for both tiers; nothing else hardcodes the set.
 *
 * THE POLICY TIER'S `leash` SPLIT — DECLARATIVE LEASH vs DERIVATION CODE (#2771, built by #2785, codified
 * [`#review-human-declarative-leash-only`](../../docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#review-human-declarative-leash-only)).
 * "An agent might be policing its own leash" was the WHOLE policy tier's rationale for forcing a human, and it
 * stranded the operator on routine derivation-code work (a lint, a refactor, a threshold *mechanic*) that the
 * #2566 conformance suite already proves behaviour-preserving. The ratified narrowing splits the tier by what a
 * member IS, recorded per-entry as `leash`:
 *   • `leash: 'spec'`  — the DECLARATIVE LEASH: the machine-diffable contract, THIS roster, and the
 *     invariant / conformance suites. These files ARE the encoded policy — there is no behaviour-preserving
 *     edit to them, so "did the spec change?" collapses to "did this file change?". They force `review:human`
 *     (`isPolicySpecPath`), and #2840 pins that floor PERMANENTLY (trigger 3).
 *   • `leash: 'code'` — the DERIVATION CODE that realizes the leash: the rubric, the disposition router, the
 *     contract loader, the land seams. A behaviour-preserving change here that keeps the conformance suite
 *     green is cleared by the sized INDEPENDENT committee (`review:pending`, no self-approval), with a human
 *     reached only on non-convergence. It still ESCALATES — it just no longer forces a human.
 * The deterministic backstop is the conformance suite: any change that alters the gate's BEHAVIOUR necessarily
 * reddens conformance, which forces a contract diff — and the contract is `leash: 'spec'`, i.e. human-gated.
 * Green ⇒ implementation ⇒ committee.
 *
 * FAIL-CLOSED BY CONSTRUCTION. `POLICY_SPEC_BASENAMES` is derived as "every policy member whose `leash` is not
 * exactly `'code'`", so a new policy entry that OMITS `leash`, or carries a typo, lands in the HUMAN set — the
 * safe direction. Dropping to the committee is never the default; it must be claimed explicitly. The invariant
 * suite additionally requires every policy member to declare a VALID `leash` (so the omission is caught at test
 * time, not merely absorbed at runtime) and pins `RATIFIED_POLICY_SPEC_FLOOR` — the four basenames #2771 named
 * — so no future edit can quietly move the contract, the roster, or a suite out of the human set.
 *
 * WHY IT LIVES HERE, AS CONFIG (#2448). Before this, the set was literal regexes buried in the scorer
 * (`GATE_SELF_PATHS` pinned to `scripts/lib/…` / `scripts/merge-ai-prs.mjs`). That silently un-anchors
 * the moment the delivery engine is extracted OUT of `we:scripts/` — the whole point of the parent epic
 * (#2445: a resident coordinator, hosted in plateau-app or its own repo). A PR editing the relocated
 * engine would no longer match the literals, so it would stop tripping `gate-self` and become
 * agent-clearable — the `review:human` invariant (exercised on PR #423) evaporating with no failing
 * test. Hoisting the set into explicit config that TRAVELS WITH the code fixes that.
 *
 * HOW IT TRAVELS (the load-bearing design). Each member is matched by its **basename**, not its full
 * path. A basename match is independent of directory and repo prefix, so relocating a member — into a
 * plateau-app module, a new package dir, or an entirely separate repo — keeps it gate-self for free
 * (`plateau-app/tools/loop/review-escalation.mjs` still trips, just like `frontierui/scripts/…` does
 * today). Basename matching is strictly MORE inclusive than the old anchored regexes, so it can only
 * ever over-escalate (force a human where one wasn't strictly needed) — the safe direction, by policy.
 * The ONE thing basename match cannot follow is a RENAME: relocate-and-rename a member and you must
 * re-register it below. That is deliberate — see the closure note.
 *
 * SELF-HOSTING BOUNDARY — the #2285 invariant, ONE LEVEL UP (#2445 DoD, #2448, two-tier flip). When the
 * delivery engine becomes a resident coordinator that drains its own PRs, the coordinator must never be the
 * sole reviewer-and-lander of a change to the code that DEFINES its own leash. That is the POLICY tier: the
 * rubric, the disposition router, this roster, the invariants — register their basenames here as `policy`, and
 * the `leash` field then decides the route: a `spec` member derives `humanRequired: true` (the coordinator
 * *cannot* auto-clear it; a human must), while a `code` member escalates to the independent committee.
 * The coordinator's ENGINE (its lander) is a different case: it obeys the leash rather than defining it, so it
 * is `engine` tier — it still escalates and runs the full panel, but a converged verdict may land it. Enforced
 * by construction (the basename match follows the code across repos), not assumed. As the coordinator gains
 * gate-critical files, add them to `TRUST_CHAIN` with the right tier — that is the whole self-hosting design:
 * the roster is the boundary, and it is versioned config the extraction carries.
 *
 * THE CLOSURE (why this file is itself gate-self). `gate-config.mjs` and the tripwire suite
 * `gate-invariants.test.mjs` are BOTH registered below, so editing the roster — or the invariants that
 * pin its properties — is itself a trust-chain change that forces `review:human`. You cannot quietly
 * DROP a member, RENAME one without re-registering, or weaken an invariant to make a diff pass: every
 * such change is human-reviewed by construction. That is the point.

/**
 * The trust chain, as explicit versioned config. Each entry is one member of the machinery that decides
 * the review gate. `file` is the matched basename (the travels-across-repos matcher); `role`/`desc` are
 * documentation; `homes` records the current known location(s) purely for auditability (the matcher does
 * NOT read `homes` — a member at any path with a registered basename is gate-self). When a member moves,
 * update `homes` for the record; when a member is RENAMED, you must change `file` — the one edit basename
 * matching cannot do for you.
 *
 * Each member also carries a `tier`: `policy` (the leash-defining machinery) or `engine` (edits escalate + run
 * the panel but a converged agent verdict may clear them — the lander that obeys the leash). Keep the POLICY
 * tier MINIMAL: it is the set whose membership even RAISES the human question — a wider policy net just
 * re-strands the queue on humans. Only machinery that decides *whether the gate fires and what clears it* is
 * `policy`; everything else (incl. the lander) is agent-reviewable.
 *
 * Every `policy` member ALSO carries `leash` (#2771/#2785) — `'spec'` (the declarative leash: forces
 * `review:human`) or `'code'` (the derivation code: escalates to the independent committee). It is REQUIRED on
 * a policy entry (the invariant suite fails an entry that omits it) and MUST NOT appear on an engine entry.
 * When adding a policy member, ask #2771's question: is this file the *encoded policy* (a contract, a roster,
 * an invariant / conformance suite — `'spec'`), or code that *derives* the gate from it (`'code'`)? If you
 * cannot answer with confidence, leave it `'spec'` and file the classification as its own decision — the
 * fail-closed direction is human, never committee.
