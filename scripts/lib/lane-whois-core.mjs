/**
 * #4344 — PURE: is a `finished-reclaimable` lane genuinely ALREADY CLEAN — nothing a `reclaim` would actually
 * change? `classifyLaneVerdict` above calls a lane `finished-reclaimable` the instant it has zero uncommitted/
 * ahead content ("nothing to lose"), with no check that the checkout is actually SITTING at the pool branch's
 * current tip on the right branch. That verdict is still correct as far as it goes — resetting such a lane
 * destroys nothing — but a periodic sweep that reclaims it ANYWAY every single pass (the exact bug this
 * function exists to let a caller avoid) burns a real git-reset process tree for genuinely nothing, every 120s,
 * across every already-idle lane in the pool.
 *
 * NARROWER than "finished-reclaimable": a lane can be clean-relative-to-HEAD (no uncommitted files, no local
 * commits ahead of `origin/<branch>`) yet still be BEHIND the tip — checked out at an old commit because
 * nothing has fast-forwarded it since `origin/<branch>` last moved — or sitting on a stray branch entirely.
 * `reclaim` still does real, useful work on either of those (its `git reset --hard origin/<branch>` actually
 * MOVES `HEAD`), so this must return `false` for them; only an EXACT head-sha match against the pool branch's
 * own current tip, on the expected branch, counts as "already clean" here. `expectedBranch` is optional (a
 * caller that only ever runs one branch pool can omit it) — omitting it just skips the branch-name check
 * rather than failing it.
 *
 * NOT A NEW STALENESS RISK (#4344): `branchTipSha` is
 * this lane's own LOCALLY-known `origin/<branch>` (no fetch of its own — see its call site in `lane-whois.mjs`).
 * That sounds like it could regress a lane whose local tracking ref is stale (real `origin/<branch>` has moved,
 * but this clone hasn't fetched). It does not: `we:scripts/lane-pool.mjs#cmdReclaim` — the ONLY thing that used
 * to run on this exact candidate set — itself resets to `origin/<branch>` with NO fetch of its own either (read
 * its body; there is no `git fetch` anywhere in `cmdReclaim`). So for a lane already sitting at ITS OWN clone's
 * locally-known tip, calling `reclaim` was ALREADY a no-op `git reset --hard` to the identical commit it is
 * already on — this predicate only removes the wasted process tree for that no-op, it changes no resulting git
 * state versus before #4344. Neither this fix nor `reclaim` refreshes a lane's knowledge of `origin/<branch>` —
 * that stays owned by `we:scripts/lane-pool.mjs#cmdRefresh` / an explicit fetch elsewhere, exactly as before.
 * FAILS CLOSED on malformed/missing input, on EVERY field (#4344 review): a `null`/non-numeric count, a missing
 * sha, or (at `reclaimFinishedLanes`'s call site in `we:scripts/conveyor/lane-pool-health-watch.mjs` — see that
 * function) a missing `expectedBranch`
 * all read as "not already clean" (falls through to a real reclaim), never as "assume clean". Omitting a count
 * is deliberately NOT the same as passing `0` — a caller that forgets to supply it must never silently pass.
 * @param {object} p
 * @param {number} [p.uncommittedCount] - required to be a real, finite number to pass at all; anything else
 *   (omitted, `null`, `NaN`, a string) fails closed.
 * @param {number} [p.aheadCount] - same requirement as `uncommittedCount`.
 * @param {string|null} [p.headSha] - this lane's current `HEAD` sha.
 * @param {string|null} [p.branchTipSha] - the pool branch's tip sha, as read from THIS lane's own clone (never
 *   a fresh fetch — the same locally-known ref `aheadCount` was already computed against).
 * @param {string|null} [p.branch] - this lane's current branch name (short form, e.g. `main`).
 * @param {string|null} [p.expectedBranch] - the pool's own branch name (short form); omitted skips this check
 *   (a deliberate opt-out for a caller that never cares about branch name — never use this to mean "unknown").
