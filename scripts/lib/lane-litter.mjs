/**
 * @file scripts/lib/lane-litter.mjs
 * @description The shared "known-safe scratch litter" allowlist + cleanup core for `we:backlog/3568-*.md`.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS. Live-observed 2026-09-07: 46 of 48 web-everything lanes were simultaneously DIRTY —
 * every one of them carrying only untracked scratch files (`.commit-msg.txt`, `.pr-body.md`, `.pr-body.txt`,
 * `review-*-output.json`, `commit-msg-fix-*.txt`) that `we:skills-src/conveyor/delivery-agent-brief.md`
 * explicitly instructs every delivery agent to write INSIDE its lane — while `lane-pool.mjs`'s `cmdRelease`
 * only ever dropped the lease marker, never the tree. The pool read 0 acquirable at once as a direct result.
 *
 * A release-time fix and a periodic reap pass both need to answer the exact same question — "is this file a
 * known-safe scratch file, safe to discard?" — and MUST agree, or the pool degrades again the moment either
 * one lags the other. This module is that single source of truth: `we:scripts/lane-pool.mjs#cmdRelease` and
 * `we:scripts/conveyor/lane-pool-health-watch.mjs` both import it rather than re-deriving it.
 *
 * #3383 — the SAME allowlist also answers a second, ACQUIRE-time question: is a lane misread as "dirty" only
 * because of this litter? `we:scripts/lane-pool.mjs`'s auto-pick (its shared cached scan), its pre-reset re-verify, and the
 * read-only `list --acquirable` / `provision --acquirable` picker (`laneAcquirableInfo`) all consult
 * {@link planLitterCleanup} (via `lane-pool.mjs`'s own `litterAdjustedDirty` helper) to set aside allowlisted
 * untracked paths before deciding `dirty`. Reusing this exact list — never a second, separately-maintained one
 * — is what keeps "a lane the picker calls acquirable" and "a lane whose litter release/reap will discard"
 * answering the same question from the same data.
 *
 * PURE CORE / IO SPLIT:
 *   • {@link LANE_RELEASE_LITTER_ALLOWLIST}, {@link isAllowlistedLitterPath}, {@link planLitterCleanup} are
 *     PURE — no fs/git/process.
 *   • {@link cleanLaneLitter} is the one IO caller (`git status --porcelain` + a scoped `git clean -f --`
 *     per allowlisted path) — never a blanket `git clean -fdx` / `reset --hard`. A tracked-file modification,
 *     or any untracked file NOT on the allowlist, is left exactly as-is: this only shrinks the false-positive
 *     "dirty" set (#2267's data-loss guard), it never widens what counts as safe to discard.

  // operational state: `queue.json`, `infra-blocked.json`, `run-scorecards.json`, lock files, `.log`s) was the
  // ONLY dirty entry on roughly two dozen of the ~90-lane pool at once, none of them holding a live lease —

  // `blocked-on-infra` with no advisory ever posted, while the pool's real free capacity sat locked behind
  // nothing but this directory. Safe to allowlist: every concrete path this repo's own `.gitignore` names under
  // `.conveyor/` is generated, regenerable session state, never product content, and a genuinely-leased lane's
  // `.conveyor/` is never reachable here at all — `isLeasedNow` (this module's own knob) still refuses to touch
  // a lane a live occupant is standing in, on this path exactly as on every other. `git clean -f` (no `-d`) on
  // an explicit directory pathspec DOES remove it when every entry beneath is untracked (verified against this
