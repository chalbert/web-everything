/**
 * @file scripts/lib/atomic-json-file.mjs
 * @description Small, generic write-temp-then-rename-then-validate helper for a JSON file multiple processes may
 *   read concurrently (e.g. `~/.claude.json`, the CLI's own per-directory trust registry) — a bare
 *   `writeFileSync` on the real path lets a concurrent reader observe a half-written file if it races the
 *   write; a `rename` on the SAME filesystem is atomic, so a reader only ever sees the old file or the new one,
 *   never a partial one. Built for card #4188 (bornAs `x5qketq`, epic #4075): the session reaper's
 *   dispatch-scratch trust revoke needed exactly this guarantee for a file that already holds every OTHER
 *   repo's per-project CLI state too, so corrupting it on a bad write is a much bigger blast radius than losing
 *   one script's own sidecar record.
 *
 * VALIDATES TWICE: once against the in-memory string before ever touching disk (a caller that handed this a
 * value `JSON.stringify` cannot render faithfully — a BigInt, a cyclic object — fails LOUD, before any write),
 * and once against the bytes actually read back off the temp file after `writeFileSync` returns (catches a
 * filesystem-level truncation the in-memory check can never see). Only then does the rename happen, so a
 * validation failure never leaves a corrupt temp file where a caller might mistake it for the real target, and
 * the real target path is never touched by a write that didn't fully verify first.
 *
 * NEVER SWALLOWS AN ERROR ITSELF — every failure here throws. A caller that wants this repo's usual
 * "best-effort, never blocks the caller" discipline (e.g. `grantDispatchTrust`'s own convention) wraps the call
 * in its own try/catch, exactly as that function already does for its writer.
 *
 * LOCK-SAFE, VIA {@link withFileLock} — LIVE-CAUGHT (2026-09-26): atomicity alone (temp+rename) prevents a
 * concurrent READER from ever seeing a torn file, but it does NOT prevent a LOST UPDATE between two concurrent
 * WRITERS each doing "read whole file, modify, write whole file" with no mutual exclusion. Proved live on this
 * exact machine: a real dispatch-scratch revoke pass reported 81 trust entries removed, but a re-read of
 * `~/.claude.json` moments later still carried every one of them — a concurrent `grantDispatchTrust` call (the
 * live daemon dispatching new sessions throughout the same window) had read its OWN stale pre-revoke snapshot
 * and written it straight back, silently reverting the revoke. {@link withFileLock} closes that gap for any
 * caller that wraps its read-modify-write in it.

/**
 * Write `data` to `path` as pretty JSON, atomically (temp file + rename), validating the JSON both before and
 * after the write.
 *
 * RESOLVES A SYMLINKED TARGET FIRST (PR #2735 red-team finding 3, epic #4075): `renameSync(tmp, path)` onto a
 * path that is itself a symlink does not "write through" it — it unlinks the symlink and puts a plain file at
 * that path instead, silently severing the link (e.g. an operator's `~/.claude.json` symlinked elsewhere by a
 * dotfile manager would stop being a symlink at all after the very first atomic write). `realpathSyncFn`
 * resolves `path` to its real target before the temp file is even named, so both the temp file and the final
 * rename land on the SAME real file the symlink already pointed at — the symlink itself is never touched. A
 * `path` that does not exist yet, or that `realpathSyncFn` otherwise cannot resolve, falls back to writing
 * `path` directly (unchanged pre-existing behavior for the common "new file" case).
 *
 * NEVER LEAVES A `.tmp` FILE BEHIND ON A RENAME FAILURE (PR #2735 finding 4): a `renameSync` failure (EXDEV
 * across filesystems, ENOSPC, a permission error) used to leave the temp file on disk forever, next to the
 * real target, once the caller's own error handling moved on. The rename is now itself wrapped exactly like the
 * post-write validation above it — clean up the temp file, then re-throw the ORIGINAL error, never swallow it.

 * Run `fn` while holding an exclusive, cross-process lock on `lockPath` (a sibling `<path>.lock` file, by

 * own header for the live incident that proved the gap). Acquisition is `open(path, 'wx')` — the one atomic
 * "create-if-absent" primitive `node:fs` offers — so two concurrent callers can never both believe they hold
 * it. A caller that cannot acquire within `timeoutMs` gets a loud throw, never a silent skip of the critical
 * section it asked to protect.
 *
 * STALE-LOCK TAKEOVER: a lock file older than `staleMs`, whose recorded holder pid is not provably alive
 * ({@link probeLockHolderLiveness}), is assumed abandoned and is reclaimed before retrying — without this, one
 * process crashing mid-section (between acquire and release) would wedge every future writer forever.
 *
 * THE TAKEOVER ITSELF IS RENAME-BASED, NEVER A PLAIN `unlinkSync` (PR #2735 red-team finding 2, epic #4075/
 * #4188): a same-filesystem `renameSync` on a single source path is atomic at the OS level — of any two
 * concurrent callers racing to move the SAME still-stale file, at most one call ever succeeds; the other gets
 * `ENOENT` (the source is already gone) rather than "succeeding" a second time against a file the first caller
 * already replaced. AND VERIFIED AFTER THE MOVE, never trusted from the earlier read alone: a caller can be
 * descheduled (real risk under heavy CPU load, this machine's own measured condition) between deciding "stale"
 * and acting on it, long enough for a DIFFERENT sibling to have already fully stolen the SAME original file and
 * re-acquired a fresh, genuinely live one of its own at the identical path — a plain rename would happily move
 * that fresh file away too, since rename never checks what it is moving. So the moved-aside file's OWN mtime
 * and recorded pid are re-checked immediately after the rename; if it turns out not to have actually been
 * stale/dead after all, it is put straight back and this caller backs off to retry normally, never proceeding
 * into `fn()` on a bad steal.
