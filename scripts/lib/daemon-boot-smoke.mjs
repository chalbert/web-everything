/**
 * @file scripts/lib/daemon-boot-smoke.mjs — #4468. Closes a real gap in `daemon-live-smoke.mjs#SMOKE_CHECKS`:
 * every existing check exercises a DISPATCH/RECONCILE CODE PATH (a dry run, a lane-pool round trip, a `gh`
 * read) — none of them ever BOOTS a daemon's own entry module, the exact file `daemon-self-sync.mjs#withSelfSync`
 * (or launchd's `KeepAlive`) next runs `node <entry>.mjs` on.
 *
 * LIVE 2026-09-29 ~10:45 ET (#2921): an overlay introduced an ESM circular-import TDZ (`ReferenceError: Cannot
 * access 'DELIVER_ITEM_RUN_SCRIPT' before initialization` in `scripts/operations/dispatch-provider-registry.mjs`,
 * imported transitively by every dispatch-shaped daemon entry via `dispatch-lane-io.mjs`). The live smoke PASSED
 * — nothing it runs ever imports that closure the way `node build-dispatch-daemon.mjs --live` actually does — so
 * the candidate was adopted, and the moment the daemon next started onto it, the process died at IMPORT time,
 * before a single line of `main()` ran. `daemon-live-smoke.mjs#rollbackToSha` — the code that would otherwise
 * roll a bad build back — runs INSIDE that same process, so a build broken this way can never roll itself back:
 * the daemon crash-loops until a human removes the overlay by hand.
 *
 * THE FIX: {@link checkDaemonEntriesBoot} spawns ONE CHILD PER ENTRY, each dynamically `import()`ing ONE module
 * from {@link DAEMON_ENTRY_MODULES} against the CANDIDATE tree (`cwd: root`) — never invoking that entry's
 * `main()`. Every entry gates its own CLI body behind an `import.meta.url === pathToFileURL(process.argv[1]).href`
 * (or the equivalent `resolve(process.argv[1]) === resolve(fileURLToPath(import.meta.url))`) guard. The harness
 * that runs here is a bare `node --input-type=module -e <script>` — in eval mode `process.argv[1]` is
 * `undefined`, not the harness's own path — so EVERY entry's guard reads false the moment it dereferences
 * `process.argv[1]` (a falsy `&&` short-circuit, or a `resolve(undefined)` throw an entry would need to guard
 * against explicitly; every entry here already does, by writing `process.argv[1] && …`). Only module-top-level
 * code (imports, top-level `const`s, the exact code that crashed live) ever executes.
 *
 * ONE CHILD PER ENTRY, NOT ONE SHARED CHILD FOR ALL SIX (#4468 review — a real correctness gap in an earlier
 * draft): Node's ESM loader caches a module by resolved URL for the LIFETIME of the process. If entry A and
 * entry B both transitively import module X, and X's own circular-import TDZ only manifests when X is reached
 * via B's particular cycle (not A's), then checking A FIRST in a shared child would warm X into the cache
 * successfully — and B's later `import()` of X would return the CACHED module without re-evaluating it,
 * silently masking exactly the class of bug this check exists to catch. A fresh child per entry means each
 * entry gets its own, cold module graph, with no cross-entry contamination possible. The entries run in
 * PARALLEL (`Promise.all`), so this costs wall-time only up to the SLOWEST entry, not the sum of all six.
 *
 * A dynamic `import()` that throws (a `ReferenceError`, a `SyntaxError`, a missing module) is caught PER ENTRY —
 * one broken entry is reported by name, and every OTHER entry still gets its own independent child, so a caller
 * sees every broken entry, not just the first — and ANY entry failing to boot fails the whole check.
 *
 * Exported as {@link DAEMON_BOOT_SMOKE_CHECK}, appended to `daemon-live-smoke.mjs#SMOKE_CHECKS` (right before
 * the always-last `tree-stays-clean` row): same check contract (`{ok, detail}`), `mayBeTransient:false` (it runs
 * code FROM the tree under test — the same rule every `cwd:root` check in that file follows), `codeEntries` =
 * {@link DAEMON_ENTRY_MODULES} itself, so `#4044`'s skip-unchanged logic still skips a re-run when none of these
 * entries' own import closure changed since the last live-verified build.
 *
 * THE STRING-SPLIT `import()` CALL BELOW, and building the specifier via `new URL(rel, 'file://' + cwd + '/')`
 * rather than a static `import … from` line, mirror `daemon-live-smoke.mjs#DISPATCH_DRY_RUN_LINES`'s own
 * documented trick: a literal `import(...)`/`import … from '...'` inside a source string is read as a real
 * import by static scanners (`we:scripts/operations/__tests__/import-graph.mjs`, and `import-closure.mjs`'s own
 * closure walker), which then tries to resolve it as if IT were this file's own import and fails, or marks the
 * closure incomplete (silently disabling skip-unchanged). Splitting the token, and avoiding `node:url`/
 * `node:path` imports in the child entirely, is invisible to both scanners while producing the exact same
 * runtime call.
