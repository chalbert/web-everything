/**
 * @file spawn-to-completion.test.mjs — contract coverage for `scripts/lib/spawn-to-completion.mjs`, the async
 * `child_process.spawn()`-based replacement for the dispatch wrappers' old blocking `execFileSync` agent spawn
 * (#3383 mechanical-dispatcher follow-up).
 *
 * DELIBERATELY REAL PROCESSES, not a mocked `child_process.spawn`. Every test below spawns a REAL `node`
 * subprocess (`process.execPath -e '<script>'`), so the assertions are grounded in what the real Node
 * child_process API actually returns, not in an assumption about its shape.
 *
 * ON `resourceUsage` SPECIFICALLY: this module's own header documents a finding worth restating here, since it
 * is exactly the kind of thing a REAL-process test (rather than a fake spawn) catches. `ChildProcess` has NO
 * `resourceUsage()` method in real Node (verified against v18.2.0 and v22.1.0, and against `@types/node`'s own
 * `child_process.d.ts`, which declares no such member) — only `process.resourceUsage()` (the CURRENT process)
 * is real. So every test below asserts `resourceUsage` is `null` for a genuine spawned child, on purpose: that
 * IS the correct, honest behavior, not a bug to fix.
