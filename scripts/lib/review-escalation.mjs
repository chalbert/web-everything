/**
 * review-escalation.mjs — the DETERMINISTIC drain review-escalation rubric (#2171, under #2162).
 *
 * The drain must decide — with NO judgment in the merge session — whether a ready `lane/*` PR gets a full
 * independent review before it merges. This module is that decision, as pure functions the drain (and its
 * tests) call: a rubric SCORER (which signals fire → escalate?), the ratified LABEL convention the reviewer
 * verdict rides on, the COUPLE rule (impl+WE couples inherit the strictest member), and the non-blocking
 * REVIEW gate (park-alive vs merge). No git/gh here — the caller supplies the signals (diff,
 * dismissed-findings count, cross-repo shape) and the observed PR labels.
 *
 * WHY deterministic: a rubric a script evaluates keeps the merge session free of judgment (which lane needs a
 * second look is decided by rule, not by the merging agent eyeballing the diff). Thresholds are TUNING KNOBS
 * — start loose, tighten from data; they live here so a change is one edit + a test, never scattered.

 * Basename match is strictly MORE inclusive than the anchored `^scripts\/` regex, so it can only ever

 * chain it cannot follow a RENAME: relocate-and-rename a member and you must re-register `file` here.
 *
 * `role`/`desc` document; `homes` records the current known location(s) for auditability only (the matcher does

 * this pass (chiefly the bare `/merge` orphan sweep — `REVIEW_ESCALATION` is `--label`-gated in
 * `merge-ai-prs.mjs`, so a bare sweep never calls `decideReviewGate` at all). WITHOUT this, a concurrent lander
 * (a second `/merge` sweep, or a bare one racing the label-scoped `/drain`) reads a PR's OTHER signals
 * (AI-generated, required check green, mergeable) and merges it straight through, even though a prior drain
 * pass already parked it under `review:pending`/`review:human` (an owed independent review, never cleared) or
 * bounced it under `review:changes` (the author lane hasn't fixed it yet) — exactly how plateau#11 and
 * web-everything#290 shipped 2 bugs the review panel had already caught but never got to act on. `review:accepted`
 * always clears it (the reviewer's verdict wins over everything else). Pure.
 *
 * A caller that DOES run `decideReviewGate` this pass (the label-scoped `/drain` role, escalation ON) must NOT
 * also apply this check — `decideReviewGate` already re-derives the correct verdict from a FRESH rubric score,
 * so double-gating on raw label presence here would fight the richer verdict. Note `decideReviewGate` never
 * sees the `--no-review-escalation` flag: under that override the CLI SKIPS `decideReviewGate` entirely
 * (`REVIEW_ESCALATION` is false in `merge-ai-prs.mjs`), and the override is honored HERE — the CLI's
 * `!REVIEW_ESCALATION` branch calls this check with `allowPending: true`, which is the ONLY place the
 * override's `review:human`/`review:changes` refusals are enforced. Do not route the override through
 * `decideReviewGate` (it has no such input) or prune this check as redundant on that path.
 *
 * `allowPending` (#2366 fix-up) — the ONE knob that separates the two `!REVIEW_ESCALATION` callers. The BARE
 * `/merge` orphan sweep (no `--label`) has no owner for the review verdict, so it refuses ALL un-cleared labels
 * (`allowPending: false`, the default — the plateau#11 / web-everything#290 race). But `--label
 * --no-review-escalation` is an OPERATOR deliberately waiving the escalation rubric to push a green-but-parked
 * `review:pending` PR through (backlog #2262's documented manual override for a parked PR with no reviewer
 * daemon) — that path passes `allowPending: true` so it honors the operator on `review:pending`, yet STILL
 * refuses `review:human` (a gate-self edit is human-only, never waivable by this flag — #2285) and
 * `review:changes` (the reviewer actively rejected the diff; the author lane must re-push). With no review
 * timeout (x30jq9n) this override is the ONE relief valve for a parked `review:pending` PR whose review never
 * arrives — and without this split a blunt `!REVIEW_ESCALATION` gate either strands that PR forever OR (if
 * relaxed wholesale) lets an un-reviewed `review:human`/`review:changes` PR merge under the override — both wrong.
