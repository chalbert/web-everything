/**
 * git-run.mjs — the ONE git runner for the drain's index-writing plumbing, plus the blob-identity primitives
 * that make "the drain staged something other than what it computed" impossible instead of merely unlikely.
 *
 * WHY THIS FILE EXISTS (#2923). Three modules used to export their own function literally named `gitRunner`,
 * each accepting a DIFFERENT subset of the options its peers pass:
 *
 *   rebase-drop-manifest.mjs  (cmd, args, { env, cwd })                  — no `input`, no `encoding`
 *   nnn-collision-heal.mjs    (cmd, args, { env, input })                — no `cwd`,   no `encoding`
 *   rebase-drop-content.mjs   (cmd, args, { env, input, cwd, encoding }) — the full contract
 *
 * `scripts/merge-ai-prs.mjs` imported the FIRST one and injected it as the `run` of libraries that need the
 * THIRD. Destructuring silently discards what it does not name, so `{ input: mergedText }` evaporated on the
 * way to `git hash-object -w --stdin`. Git then read EOF on an empty stdin, hashed the empty string, **exited
 * 0**, and printed `e69de29bb2d1d6434b8b29ae775ad8c2e48c5391` — the empty blob. Every `status !== 0` check
 * passed, `update-index --cacheinfo` staged the empty blob, and the drain committed and reported success. The
 * conflicted file landed at ZERO BYTES with a commit message claiming it had been auto-resolved.
 *
 * That fired at least three times: `836ae978` (backlog/2909, the reported case), `70bffbb8` (backlog/2895),
 * and — through the renumber path, `writePlanToIndex` — `adf2d758`, which reached `main` and had to be
 * hand-repaired by `14432ba9` ("restore #2309 story content emptied by the #2362->#2309 renumber"). Every one
 * was caught only because the emptied file happened to be a backlog card, the one content type with a schema
 * validator. A doc or source file emptied the same way has no such tripwire and lands silently.
 *
 * So this module fixes it at BOTH levels:
 *   1. ONE runner (`gitRun`) with ONE contract, re-exported as `gitRunner` by all three modules — there is no
 *      longer a weaker same-named function for a caller to inject by accident.
 *   2. Content-addressed VERIFICATION (`gitBlobOid` / `hashObjectVerified`) — the expected object id is
 *      computed IN PROCESS from the bytes we intended to write, with no git involved, and compared to what
 *      git actually returned. Any runner that drops, truncates, re-encodes or mangles stdin is caught at the
 *      write, before anything is staged. This holds even if some future caller injects a broken `run` again:
 *      the guarantee no longer depends on the runner being correct, only on it being CHECKED.
