/**
 * @file scripts/lib/lane-transcript-attribution.mjs
 * @description EXACT ATTRIBUTION FROM CLAUDE SESSION TRANSCRIPTS (#3383). The lane-history ledger
 *   (`lane-history.mjs`) only knows what happened AFTER it was wired in - every lane already carries months of
 *   prior work no lease marker or ledger line ever recorded. Claude session transcripts
 *   (`~/.claude/projects/PROJECT/*.jsonl`, including `.../subagents/*.jsonl`) already record every Edit/Write/
 *   NotebookEdit tool call with its absolute `file_path`, and every Bash call with its `command` text - so a
 *   session that wrote exactly the files sitting uncommitted in a lane is strong, checkable evidence of who
 *   last worked there, independent of (and often finer-grained than) a commit message or branch name guess.
 *
 * PURE / IO SPLIT:
 *   - {@link laneTouchFromLine} - pure, one already-matched JSONL line -> a touch record or `null`.
 *   - {@link summarizeLaneTouches} - pure, touches -> per-session ranking (coverage against the lane's ACTUAL
 *     dirty paths beats a bare "did this session ever cd here" guess - a session that merely passed through a
 *     lane proves far less than one whose edited-file set matches what's sitting uncommitted).
 *   - {@link scanLaneTranscripts} - the IO shell. ONE pass across the WHOLE transcript tree for every lane's
 *     path pattern at once (never one grep per lane - #3383's own performance note).
 *
 * #3383-perf (follow-up): this used to be TWO steps — list matching FILES (`grep -rlE .../ rg -l`), then read
 * each one's FULL content into Node and re-split/re-scan every line there. Measured live against the real
 * `~/.claude/projects` tree (3.4GB): the file listing itself is fast (well under a second, ripgrep/grep's own
 * job), but the matching files still total gigabytes of mostly-IRRELEVANT lines (a transcript's tool-use lines
 * for everything else it ever touched) — reading and JS-side re-scanning all of that cost 45s of a ~100s whole
 * run, the single largest remaining piece after the `gh`-call and per-commit git-spawn fixes. The fix: have
 * `rg`/`grep` emit the MATCHING LINES directly (one call, whole tree, same alternation) — the actual work of
 * finding "does this byte range match" already belongs to a tool built for exactly that, and Node then only
 * ever sees the (tiny, by comparison) handful of lines that could possibly matter, never the surrounding bulk.

 * alternation (`-E '<esc1>|<esc2>|…'`): measured live against the real `~/.claude/projects` tree, an `-E`
 * alternation of 71 escaped literals cost far more of `grep`'s own native scan time than `-F` does for the
 * identical needle set — `grep`'s regex-NFA engine handles a big OR-alternation far worse than its dedicated
 * multi-literal path (`-F`, a Boyer-Moore/Commentz-Walter-shaped search built for exactly "many fixed needles
 * at once"). Absolute lane paths are already fixed strings with no wildcard need, so `-F` costs nothing in
 * capability. Patterns are staged to a real temp file (`-f <path>`), never piped over stdin — simpler to
 * reason about alongside a large stdout, and there is no reason to risk the pipe-interaction edge cases a
 * synchronous parent/child read-and-write-at-once shape can hit.
 *
 * Tries `rg` (ripgrep) FIRST, falling back to `grep -hF` only if that call itself fails (not installed on
 * `PATH` as a real executable — note this is NOT guaranteed even on a host where an interactive shell defines
 * an `rg` alias/function of its own, since a plain subprocess spawn never resolves shell functions — or any
 * other error). No separate "is rg installed" probe call — that would cost a second spawn on every run just to
 * decide, which defeats its own purpose; trying it directly costs nothing extra when it succeeds, and exactly
 * one fallback spawn on a host without a REAL standalone `rg` binary. Best-effort throughout: no candidate
 * files, an absent binary, a "no matches" exit, or a timeout all degrade to `[]` - a transcript-attribution
 * miss must never fail the `whois` report it feeds.
 * @param {string[]} files - explicit file list (from {@link recentTranscriptFiles}), never a directory to walk.
 * @param {string[]} needles - absolute lane paths, fed as literal (never regex) patterns.
