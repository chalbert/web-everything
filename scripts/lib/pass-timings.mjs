/**
 * @file scripts/lib/pass-timings.mjs
 * @description Per-step wall-clock timing for one drain pass (we:scripts/merge-ai-prs.mjs) — filed against
 *   "why so slow" (the resident drain daemon, `com.plateau.drain-daemon`, was seen taking 9-18 min per pass
 *   to merge 2-3 PRs with NO per-step breakdown anywhere: `we:.drain-daemon/history.jsonl` and its `daemon.log`
 *   recorded only the pass's total `ms`, so nobody could tell where the time went).
 *
 * Dependency-free and pure (the caller supplies `now`, default `Date.now`), so this is unit-testable without
 * any real I/O or timers. `we:scripts/merge-ai-prs.mjs`'s `sweepOnce()` is the one caller: it creates ONE
 * `createStepTimer()` per pass, wraps/marks the major steps (listing, per-PR classify/gate reads,
 * rebase-drop-manifest, the merge cascade + the actual `gh pr merge` call inside it, the post-merge local/
 * primary sync, JIT numbering, resolve-on-land, the numbering push, the duplicate-id tripwire scan, and the
 * derived-artifact regen), and attaches the resulting `{ ...steps, total }` map onto `result.timings` (so it
 * rides the pass's own `--json` output) plus renders `formatTimingsSummary` as ONE unconditional stderr log
 * line (see `we:scripts/merge-ai-prs.mjs`'s `sweepOnce` — the line prints regardless of `--json`, unlike this
 * file's other progress lines, because the resident daemon always passes `--json` and its stderr is the ONLY
 * channel that reaches `we:.drain-daemon/daemon.log`).
 *
 * Persisting `timings` into `history.jsonl` itself is a SEPARATE, plateau-app-side change (its
 * `tools/drain-daemon/lib.mjs#parsePassResult` reshapes the child's `--json` into the persisted entry through
 * a fixed field allow-list, so an unlisted field — `timings` included — is silently dropped today). That is
 * plateau-app product code and lands through a plateau-app lane, never from here (see this WE PR's own body).

/**
 * A per-pass accumulator: every step this pass's clock touches, keyed by a short label, summed in
 * milliseconds. Multiple `time`/`timeAsync`/`add` calls against the SAME label accumulate (never overwrite)
 * so a step that runs more than once in a pass (e.g. "listing" = the context listing + the candidate listing,
 * two separate awaited calls) reports its TOTAL cost under one key.
 * @param {() => number} [now] - injectable clock (default `Date.now`), so tests can supply a deterministic one
 * @returns {{
 *   time: <T>(label: string, fn: () => T) => T,
 *   timeAsync: <T>(label: string, fn: () => Promise<T>) => Promise<T>,
 *   add: (label: string, deltaMs: number) => void,
 *   mark: () => number,
