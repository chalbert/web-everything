/**
 * codex-judge-spawn.mjs — the SECOND `JudgeProvider` implementation (#xqa9ttq, under #3369/#3370), Codex CLI
 * as a READ-ONLY-SHELL panelist (NOT tool-free — see below).
 *
 * EVERY CLAIM BELOW WAS PROVEN LIVE, NOT DERIVED FROM DOCS — `#3371`'s ten probes against `codex-cli 0.153.4`
 * on a real ChatGPT subscription are the evidentiary record this module translates into code. This header
 * points at the probe that proves each design choice rather than re-arguing it; re-read `#3371` before
 * changing any of the argv/parsing decisions here.
 *
 * WHAT THIS SATISFIES: the SAME `JudgeProvider` port `judgeSpawn` (`we:scripts/lib/judge-spawn.mjs`)
 * implements — `(request: JudgeProviderRequest) => Promise<JudgeProviderOutcome>`, named in
 * `we:scripts/operations/cli-adapter.mjs`. Nothing about the port's shape changed to make this true (`#3371`'s
 * verdict: "the port's shape survives the probe intact").
 *
 * NO TOOL ALLOW-LIST — BUT A REAL READ-ONLY SHELL, NOT ZERO TOOLS. There is no `allowedTools`/lane-cwd
 * parameter here, and there never should be one added casually: probe 9 found NO context-strip flag for a
 * tool-bearing Codex juror in a lane cwd (`-C` always loads `we:AGENTS.md`). But `-s read-only` (see
 * `buildCodexJudgeArgv`) is a REAL shell, confirmed live: `git --version`/`git status` exit 0; only a WRITE
 * (`mktemp -d`, writing a file) gets `Operation not permitted`. So this provider is NOT "tool-free" — it can
 * read and run non-mutating commands, it simply cannot write, create temp dirs/files, or mutate anything, and
 * that ceiling is fixed by the sandbox flag rather than by any configurable allow-list (there is no allow-list
 * mechanism here to configure). Per `#3581`'s ratified sequencing this provider is seated first with that
 * read-only posture. `assertNoCodexToolAllowlist` below REFUSES a request carrying `allowedTools` — there is
 * nothing for such a list to configure — rather than silently ignoring it.
 *
 * THE FOUR THINGS THAT DO NOT TRANSLATE FROM `judge-spawn.mjs`, EACH RECORDED WHERE IT DIFFERS:
 *
 *   1. ARGV IS A DIFFERENT LIST, not a renamed one. `-p --output-format json` becomes `exec --json` (a JSONL
 *      STREAM, not one document); `--json-schema '<inline>'` becomes `--output-schema <FILE>` — a temp file
 *      this module writes and cleans up; `--append-system-prompt` has NO EQUIVALENT, so the mandate is folded
 *      into the prompt text sent on stdin; `--tools ''` has no equivalent either — `-s read-only` is the
 *      nearest control and it is sandbox-based, not tool-removal. See `buildCodexJudgeArgv`.
 *
 *   2. THE STDIN TRAP (probe 0). `codex exec` takes its prompt as a POSITIONAL argument, and per its own
 *      `--help`: "If not provided as an argument (or if `-` is used), instructions are read from stdin." A
 *      spawn that supplies BOTH a positional prompt AND a piped, never-closed stdin hangs forever — reproduced
 *      live, killed at 300s. This module supplies NO positional prompt at all (mirroring `judge-spawn.mjs`'s
 *      own "why stdin carries the input" discipline) and relies on `child.stdin.end(text)`, which CLOSES the
 *      stream, to be the thing that makes this safe — exactly the property `judgeSpawn` already leans on.
 *
 *   3. OUTPUT IS JSONL, AND THE ANSWER IS THE LAST THING, NEVER THE FIRST (probes 5, 7). A multi-turn run's
 *      only schema-constrained message is its FINAL `agent_message` (probe 7) — everything before it is free
 *      prose a naive "first agent_message" parser would wrongly treat as the answer. `--output-last-message
 *      <FILE>` is the clean seam for this (this module always passes it and prefers it), with a JSONL
 *      fallback for when that file was never written (killed mid-run, probe 6). Terminal STATUS is likewise
 *      the LAST event (`turn.completed`/`turn.failed`), never the first: probe 5's auth failure emits a ~30s,
 *      ~12-event retry storm across two transports before the real `turn.failed`, and a parser reading the
 *      first `error` line would report a transient retry as the final word.
 *
 *   4. THREE PORT FIELDS CANNOT BE FILLED HONESTLY, so they are not faked (`#3371`'s verdict, verbatim):
 *      `costUsd` is always `0` (no USD figure exists anywhere in Codex's output — only token counts);
 *      `sessionId` is OBSERVED off the `thread.started` event, never derived, so it is not deterministic
 *      before the run the way `judgeSpawn`'s `deriveSessionId` is; `JudgeBudgetError` cannot be constructed at
 *      all (no spend ceiling exists to have been hit), so this module never throws it — a `budget` on the
 *      request is accepted for port-shape compatibility and silently has no effect, which is recorded here
 *      rather than left to be rediscovered.
 *
 * PURE except `codexJudgeSpawn`, which spawns a subprocess and writes/removes temp files, and takes an
 * injectable `spawnFn` exactly like `judgeSpawn` does. `buildCodexJudgeArgv` and `parseCodexJudgeOutcome` are
 * pure, mirroring the split `judge-spawn.mjs` uses for the same testability reason: the whole argv/parsing
 * contract is unit-testable at zero cost, and exactly one integration test pays for a real spawn.
 *
 * A LEAF MODULE, DELIBERATELY — imports nothing from the review/jury seams, mirroring `judge-spawn.mjs`'s own
 * "A LEAF module" discipline exactly, and `requireAllProperties`/`stripNulls` (the schema-transform pair) are
 * DEFINED HERE rather than in `we:scripts/lib/jury-core.mjs`, where an earlier draft put them, FOR A REAL
 * REASON RECORDED SO IT IS NOT RE-INTRODUCED: `jury-core.mjs` imports `review-escalation.mjs`, which needs the
 * `markdown-it` npm package. `we:scripts/operations/cli-adapter.mjs` (this module's only caller) is itself
 * imported at module-load time by `we:scripts/backlog.mjs` and other lightweight CLI entry points — and SEVERAL
 * of those are exercised by this repo's own "ephemeral clone" test harness (`we:scripts/__tests__/
 * number-stranded-locus.test.mjs`, `backlog-cli-snapshot.test.mjs`, `we:scripts/backlog/__tests__/
 * resolve-parent-cli.test.mjs`, the #2273/#2274 pattern), which copies ONLY the `scripts/` tree into an
 * isolated tmp directory with NO `node_modules` at all, to prove CLI behaviour decoupled from cwd/lane state.
 * A `cli-adapter.mjs → jury-core.mjs → review-escalation.mjs → markdown-it` static import edge is EAGER (ESM
 * resolves every static import at load time, whether or not the code path that needs it ever runs), so it
 * broke ALL THREE of those harnesses with `ERR_MODULE_NOT_FOUND: Cannot find package 'markdown-it'` — caught
 * only by actually running the full suite, exactly the class of bug `we:docs/agent/prototype-based-dev.md`
 * warns a mocked-only test suite cannot see. `jury-core.mjs` already carried this dependency for its OWN
 * reasons (`CARE_LEVELS`); the defect was `cli-adapter.mjs` gaining a NEW edge to it that did not exist before
 * this provider. Keeping these two functions here, with zero jury/review imports, is what keeps that edge from
 * reappearing — do not move them back to `jury-core.mjs` without re-solving this.

/**
 * #xqa9ttq — THE OPENAI-STRICT SCHEMA TRANSFORM, proved live against a real `codex exec` spawn in `#3371`
 * probes 3/4 before this function existed. `we:scripts/lib/judge-spawn.mjs`'s Claude-backed jurors use
 * `--json-schema`, which tolerates a `required` list narrower than `properties` — the repo's own judge shapes
 * (`REVIEW_JUDGE_SHAPE`, `REVIEW_PREP_JUDGE_SHAPE`, `SYNTHESIS_SHAPE`) all lean on that: `findings[]` items
 * declare fourteen properties and require only `summary`. OpenAI's structured-output mode (what a Codex
 * `--output-schema` compiles to) is STRICTER and REJECTS that shape outright — probe 3 reproduced the exact
 * 400: `"'required' is required to be supplied and to be an array including every key in properties. Missing
 * 'file'."` Probe 4 proved the fix mechanically: walk the schema, and at every `object` node add EVERY declared
 * property key to `required`.
 *
 * WHY A NEWLY-REQUIRED PROPERTY ALSO NEEDS `null` FOLDED INTO ITS `type`. Forcing `required` without touching
 * `type` would ask the model to always supply a value for a field a Claude-shaped juror was allowed to omit —
 * which is not the same request. Probe 4's own real response proved OpenAI's actual behaviour: a field the
 * juror had nothing to say about came back as `null` explicitly (`"file":null`, `"line":null`,
 * `"parallelizable":null`), never omitted. So a property is widened to accept `null` alongside its declared
 * type IF AND ONLY IF it was not already required — a property the schema's AUTHOR already demanded (like
 * `summary`) keeps its original type unchanged, because that field was never optional and widening it would
 * silently invite a `null` a caller downstream (`normalizeFinding`) is not written to expect there.
 *
 * ONLY THE CODEX PATH CALLS THIS. `we:scripts/lib/judge-spawn.mjs`'s Claude argv sends the ORIGINAL shape,
 * untouched — see this function's own call site in `we:scripts/operations/cli-adapter.mjs#resolveJudgeProvider`.
 * Transforming the shared shape constants themselves (rather than transforming a copy at the Codex call site)
 * would change what every EXISTING Claude juror is asked for, which is exactly the regression `#3371`'s verdict
 * warns against.
 *
 * WHY THIS LIVES HERE AND NOT IN `jury-core.mjs`: see this file's own header — a real import-graph regression,
 * caught by the repo's ephemeral-clone CLI tests, not a style preference.
 *
 * PURE AND RECURSIVE: walks `properties`/`items`/`anyOf`/`oneOf`/`allOf`/`$defs` so a nested object node (a
 * finding INSIDE a findings array, say) gets the same treatment as the top-level one. A node with no
 * `properties` (a `{type: 'string'}` leaf, an already-built `$ref`) is returned unchanged — there is nothing to
 * widen. Never mutates its input; returns a new tree throughout, top to bottom, so a caller holding the
 * original constant is never surprised by an in-place edit.
 *
 * @param {*} schema - a JSON Schema node (object, array item schema, or a whole document).
 * @returns {*} an equivalent node, transformed for OpenAI strict mode. Non-object/array input is returned as-is.

 * #xqa9ttq — STRIP `null` VALUES BEFORE A CODEX ANSWER REACHES `normalizeFinding` (`#3371` probe 4).

 * matching RESPONSE-side half. A property Claude simply omits arrives from Codex as `key: null` instead
 * (probe 4's real, reproduced response carried `"file":null,"line":null,"parallelizable":null`). Left alone,
 * every Codex-judged finding would carry keys no Claude-judged finding ever has, and — more concretely —
 * `normalizeFinding`'s own null-BLIND checks would misfire: `if (raw.file) …` already treats `null` as absent
 * correctly, but `for (const k of ['introduced', ...]) if (typeof raw[k] === 'boolean')` also already excludes
 * `null` correctly. The risk this closes is everything OUTSIDE `normalizeFinding` that a Codex-backed shape may
 * one day feed (`SYNTHESIS_SHAPE` and friends have no normalizer at all) and would otherwise see `null` where a
 * Claude-backed run never emits the key — so the strip happens once, generically, before ANY consumer sees the
 * value, rather than being re-derived per shape or trusted to each downstream reader's own null-tolerance.
 *
 * DEEP AND PURE. Walks arrays and plain objects; a `null` ARRAY ELEMENT is left in place — dropping it would
 * shift every later index, silently corrupting positional data (e.g. a `findings[]` list). Only a `null`
 * OBJECT PROPERTY is removed, which cannot shift anything since object keys carry no position. Never mutates
 * its input.

 * An ALLOWLIST, not a denylist of "known-bad" names: a denylist only protects against secrets whose naming

 * etc. do not resolve under `~`, while pointing `CODEX_HOME` at the operator's real Codex config dir so Codex
 * still finds its auth. This is NOT confinement: the read-only sandbox does not stop absolute-path reads of the
