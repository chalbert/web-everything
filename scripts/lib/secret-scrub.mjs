/**
 * @file secret-scrub.mjs — the PURE secret/credential/PII detector core (#3015, under #2978 Fork 3).
 *
 * The regex + entropy core used to live inline in we:scripts/conveyor/learnings-drop.mjs, where it gated the
 * APPEND seam of the learnings drop-box. That seam guards a machine-local, untracked JSONL pool; the seam
 * that actually matters — where content becomes a COMMITTED, PUSHED artifact (a `backlog/*.md` card, a
 * memory topic file) — had no scrub at all. #2978 Fork 3 ratified moving the gate "from the append seam to
 * the publish seam". This module is the shared pure home (mirrors we:scripts/lib/write-all-sync.mjs) that
 * every seam's callers import; nothing re-implements it (we:docs/agent/platform-decisions.md
 * #deterministic-core-thin-judgment).
 *
 * TWO exported detectors, deliberately different in width:
 *
 *   • `scrubReasons(value)` — the FULL append-seam set (secrets + paths + code + PII + repo-identifying
 *     names). Its width is a TENANT-READY-BY-CONSTRUCTION requirement of the drop-box schema (#2610): a
 *     learnings entry must carry no raw code and no repo-identifying path, because that pool later feeds a
 *     multi-tenant product feedback channel. Kept exported + unit-tested; no longer wired into
 *     `validateEntry` (#3015 moved the gate).
 *   • `scrubPublish(value)` — the PUBLISH-seam detector. STRICTLY NARROWER, and every omission below is a
 *     measured decision, not an oversight. See "WHAT scrubPublish DOES NOT CATCH".
 *
 * Both are pure (string → string[] of human reasons; empty ⇒ clean), so every caller composes them the same
 * way: `if (reasons.length) deny/die(...)`, always BEFORE the write executes.
 *
 * ── WHAT `scrubPublish` CATCHES ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *   1. Known-prefix credentials — PEM blocks, `sk-/pk-/rk-`, `ghp_/gho_/…`, `github_pat_`, `xox…`, `AKIA…`,
 *      `AIza…`, JWTs, and a URL with inline `user:pass@host` credentials.
 *   2. A LABELED credential whose value is secret-shaped (`password: …`, `api_key=…`).
 *   3. Two entropy detectors, CALIBRATED against the whole committed corpus (3,319 `backlog/*.md` +
 *      memory files) so the gate has ZERO false positives on content this repo already considers correct:
 *        • long opaque blob — a ≥40-char run over the base64/base64url alphabet with Shannon entropy
 *          ≥ 4.8 bits/char. Measured: the corpus's most-random 40-char run scores 4.55 (a long
 *          `/backlog/NNN-slug` route), while random 32/45-byte base64 secrets score ~5.3–5.9. Detection on
 *          synthetic secrets: 79% (32-byte base64), 100% (45-byte base64), 65% (32-byte base64url).
 *        • opaque token — a 20–256 char whitespace/slash-delimited segment over `[A-Za-z0-9+=_]`, not pure
 *          hex, entropy ≥ 3.0, vowel ratio < 0.20. Measured: the corpus's least-pronounceable such segment
 *          is `REGISTRY_SCRIPT_TYPE` at 0.222, so 0.20 leaves real margin under real identifiers.
 *   4. PII — ONLY public IPv4/IPv6 addresses and personal-mailbox-shaped email addresses. Phone numbers and
 *      street addresses are NOT covered (see "DOES NOT CATCH" below).
 *
 * ── WHAT `scrubPublish` DOES NOT CATCH (named, so the gap is a decision) ───────────────────────────
 *   • LENGTH FLOORS — the blob rule requires ≥40 chars, the token rule ≥20 chars. So ANY opaque credential
 *     under 20 characters is undetected, regardless of alphabet: a 16-char random alnum key, a 12-char
 *     unlabeled password. This is the single most common leak shape not covered by anything below.
 *   • CODE, repo paths, and the repo's own name (`CODE_PATTERNS`, `CODE_EXT`/`DOC_EXT`, `REPO_NAMES`).
 *     Ratified out in #3015: the destination here is the repo's OWN corpus, where citing a `we:`-prefixed
 *     repo path is REQUIRED (#883, we:docs/agent/conventions.md) and quoting an identifier is ordinary
 *     authorship.
 *   • ABSOLUTE FILESYSTEM PATHS (`/a/b/…`, `~/…`, `C:\…`, `file://`). The card for #3015 expected to keep
 *     these; MEASUREMENT retired them. The append-seam path rules fire on 1,077 of the 3,319 committed
 *     corpus files, and every sampled hit is legitimate: site-relative routes (`/backlog/NNN-slug`,
 *     `/blocks/component`, `/api/backlog`) and the repo's own documented machine conventions
 *     (`~/.claude/settings.json`, `~/workspace/.lanes/<repo>/lane-N` — a path this very repo prints in its
 *     own error messages). A rule that fires on a third of the corpus and never on a credential is not a
 *     control; it is noise that trains authors to route around the gate. A real `/Users/<name>/…` paste is
 *     therefore NOT blocked here — the #883 locus-prefix gate remains the rule that governs path hygiene.
 *   • BARE HEX TOKENS (the append seam's "≥20 hex chars" rule). A 40-char lowercase-hex git SHA and a
 *     40-char hex session token are the same string by shape, and citing a commit SHA is recurring,
 *     legitimate backlog content (5 such citations in the corpus today). Pure-hex runs are explicitly
 *     EXEMPTED from the opaque-token rule for the same reason. So a raw hex secret pasted with no label and
 *     no prefix passes this gate.
 *   • ~20–35% of random base64/base64url blobs, and most base64url tokens containing `-` (that character
 *     also spells ordinary hyphenated prose and UUIDs, which the corpus is full of). The blob rule is a
 *     probabilistic entropy test, not a proof.
 *   • A secret SPLIT across two writes, or one added by a write path that calls neither `writeBacklogMd`
 *     nor the `Edit`/`Write` tools — the `check:standards` corpus sweep is the later backstop for that, and
 *     a sweep is a catch, not a same-turn deny.
 *   • PII other than email/IPv4/IPv6 — phone numbers (E.164 or otherwise) and street addresses are NOT
 *     covered. Catch-item 4 above is narrower than the word "PII" alone would suggest.
