/**
 * @file scripts/lib/prevention-landing-job.mjs
 * @description THE SHARED DETACHED PREVENTION-CARD LANDING SEAM (#4493). Any caller that must file an owed
 * prevention-guard backlog card WITHOUT writing into whatever checkout it happens to be running in (a read-only
 * daemon clone, the primary checkout, or any other non-lane tree) spawns `we:scripts/operations/land-
 * prevention-card.mjs` (#4317) through {@link spawnPreventionLandingJob} rather than shelling `file-item`
 * in-process there.
 *
 * EXTRACTED HERE (#4493), out of `we:scripts/review-set-label.mjs#fileApprovalPreventionCard` (#4317's own
 * original, single caller), because a SECOND caller had the exact same bug: `we:scripts/operations/review-
 * loop-cli.mjs#fileItemForPrevention` still drove `file-item` IN PROCESS, against whatever checkout is running
 * the review daemon (routinely `~/workspace/wev-review-daemon`, never committed, never pushed — 74 untracked
 * `backlog/x*.md` cards there as of 2026-09-29, orphaned by BOTH filing callers, not only the one #4317 fixed).
 * Two callers, one bug, one fix: this file is now the ONE place either seam builds its `file-item` argv and
 * spawns the landing job, so a future third caller reuses it too instead of re-deriving a third copy.
 *
 * PURE-ISH, IMPURE ONLY AT THE ONE SPAWN. {@link spawnPreventionLandingJob} validates nothing about WHAT is
 * being filed (that is each caller's own pure builder — `we:scripts/lib/approval-prevention-notice.mjs
 * #buildApprovalPreventionFilingInput` for the approval-time caller, `we:scripts/lib/review-loop-policy.mjs
 * #buildPreventionFilingInput` for the review-loop caller) — it only knows how to hand a composed `file-item`
 * input off to the detached job and report a spawn handle, never a filed card's real number (that is known only
 * once the job's own lane + file-item + verify + open-pr sequence lands it, which this function does not wait
 * for — see `land-prevention-card.mjs`'s own header for the full "can therefore never cost the approval/accept
 * that already happened" invariant this preserves for every caller).
 *
 * @see we:scripts/operations/land-prevention-card.mjs for the detached job itself.

/**
 * SPAWN THE DETACHED LANDING JOB. See the file header for the full account. Never throws; every failure comes
 * back as `{ok:false, error}`, because a caller's own filing step must never crash over a landing-job spawn —
 * the approval/accept it rides may already have happened.
 *
 * WHY DETACHED, NOT INLINE. Every caller of this function runs SYNCHRONOUSLY on its own critical path (an
 * approval that already landed, or a review-loop round that is about to resume to `accept`), and must stay
 * fast and non-blocking: the full lane-acquire + file-item + verify + open-pr sequence is the same multi-minute
 * arc a delivery agent runs. So this function's ONLY synchronous work is spawning that sequence as its own
 * detached, unref'd process (`defaultSpawnDetached`) and returning; the spawned job (`land-prevention-card.mjs`)
 * does the real acquire/file-item/verify/open-pr/release work on its own time.
 *
 * `num`/`rel` are ALWAYS `null` in the return value — the card's real id is not known until the spawned job
 * files it, minutes later. A caller that wants a synchronous number when a PAST run's card has already reached
 * this checkout (via a daemon rebuild, say) checks its own on-disk idempotency lookup FIRST and never calls this
 * function at all in that case (see `runApprovalPreventionFiling`'s own `findApprovalPreventionCardOnDisk` call
 * for the approval-time caller's version of that short-circuit).
 *
 * `input.retractTo` (`{repo, pr, headSha}`, optional): if the job fails after this spawn succeeded, it posts a
 * retraction of its own marker for that head, so the next attempt on the same head retries instead of the guard
 * being lost for good (#4317 advisory review, 2026-09-29). The returned `session` is the job's slug, which a
 * caller's own marker (if it posts one) should name, so a later retraction can be matched to the right job.
 *
 * @param {{title:string,kind:string,size:string,digest:string,scope:string,parent?:string,queue:string,
 *   retractTo?:{repo:string,pr:(number|string),headSha:string}}} input
 * @param {{spawnDetached?: Function, logPathFor?: Function, runScript?: string, root?: string,
 *   resolveSettingsEnv?: Function, sessionPrefix?: string}} [o] - `sessionPrefix` lets each caller's spawned
 *   jobs stay distinguishable in the shared log directory (`prevention-card` for the approval-time caller,
 *   `review-loop-prevention` for the review-loop one) without changing anything else about the seam.
 * @returns {{ok:boolean, num:(number|null), rel:(string|null), error:(string|null), handle?:string,
 *   session?:string}}
