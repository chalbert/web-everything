/**
 * @file commit-message-safety.mjs — the #2779-incident guard (2026-09-26 03:14Z).
 *
 * INCIDENT. PR #2785 (branch `lane/2779-session-token-fresh`) merged; the drain's own resolve-on-land
 * bookkeeping then committed `drain: resolve #2779 on land (#2748)`. GitHub reads "resolve #2779" as a CLOSING
 * KEYWORD reference — the same vocabulary as "closes #N" / "fixes #N" — so pushing that commit to `main`
 * auto-closed pull request #2779 (a real, unmerged bg-isolation fix, wrongly credited as this PR's own
 * database identically to how "resolves #2779 …") as a side effect nobody intended. GitHub's closing-keyword
 * grammar (https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/working-with-advanced-formatting/using-keywords-in-issues-and-pull-requests)
 * fires on `close(s|d)?`, `fix(es|ed)?`, `resolve(s|d)?` immediately followed by `#N` (optionally with a colon
 * in between), in EITHER a commit message that lands on the repo's default branch OR a PR/issue body — never
 * in a plain comment. The drain's OWN commit messages are exactly such commit messages, so every template it
 * writes must be provably free of this shape before it is ever handed to `git commit -m`.
 *
 * THE FIX IS NOT "never say resolve" — the drain's job IS to say a card resolved. The fix is: refer to the
 * card by its bare number (`card 2779`, `card:2779`) rather than by `#2779`. That reads identically to a human
 * and is fully searchable/grep-able, but carries none of GitHub's auto-close grammar, because the trigger is
 * the `#N` sigil specifically, not the word "resolve" alone.
 *
 * `hasClosingKeywordRef` is the pure detector (unit-tested directly); `assertNoClosingKeywordRef` is the
 * RUNTIME guard every drain-authored commit-message template is wrapped in (`lane-drain.mjs`) — belt AND
 * suspenders, so a future edit that reintroduces the shape fails LOUD, at the point of the write, rather than
 * silently landing on `main` and closing someone else's PR again.
