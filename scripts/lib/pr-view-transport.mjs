/**
 * @file scripts/lib/pr-view-transport.mjs
 * @description THE CI-STAGED PR VIEW TRANSPORT, named once (#xaoja7a) — the branch, the two directories, the
 *   ref a view may be read from, the git argv that reads it, and the request a session pushes to ask for one.
 *
 * WHY IT EXISTS. `we:scripts/operations/stage-pr-view.mjs` took the PR's body, comments and file list from a
 * session-supplied file, because this host has no mechanical read path: `gh api` answers
 * `403 GitHub access is not enabled` and GraphQL serves only the pinned review-operation set. So the REVIEWING
 * session transcribed the PR into the view a juror then read, and nothing verified the transcription.
 * Observed live on PR #1542: the staged view carried a paraphrase of the body in the session's own voice plus a
 * comment the session had written itself, stamped `authorAssociation: OWNER`, that does not exist on the PR at
 * all. `authorAssociation` exists precisely so a juror can weight an owner's word above a drive-by, so
 * synthesizing one inverts the signal — it puts words in the operator's mouth inside the evidence.
 *
 * THE SHAPE IS THE APPLIER'S, POINTED AT READ. `we:.github/workflows/apply-review-request.yml` already does
 * this in the WRITE direction and is proven in production: a credential-less session pushes a FILE to an ops
 * branch, and a workflow holding a token acts on it. This is the sibling flow — the session pushes a REQUEST
 * (`{repo, pr}`), `we:.github/workflows/stage-pr-view.yml` runs `gh pr view --json` and commits the view back,
 * and the session reads it out of the fetched ref. The session never authors the material.
 *
 * ── THE SUBTLETY THAT MAKES OR BREAKS IT, and why {@link TRANSPORT_REF} is a constant ────────────────────────
 *
 * CI producing the view is NOT sufficient on its own. If the reader can still be pointed at a path — a local
 * file, a temp file `git show` was redirected into, a ref the caller names — the session can fetch the
 * CI-produced view, edit it, and stage that instead. The hole moves one step back and nothing has changed.
 *
 * So the ref is NOT a parameter anywhere on this path. {@link showViewArgv} builds
 * `git show origin/ops/pr-views:<path>` from constants in this file, the bytes go from that subprocess's stdout
 * straight into the check, and no input field of the operation can reach either half. A session that wants to
 * change what is read has to change THIS file, in a diff, under review — which is the difference between a
 * control and a convention.
 *
 * PURE, AND IT IMPORTS NOTHING. `we:scripts/operations/stage-pr-view.mjs` asserts its own import graph is free
 * of `node:` modules ("the declaration reaches nothing that can act"), and it imports these constants, so a
 * single `node:path` here would redden that test. String concatenation over `join` is deliberate for the same
 * reason: these are git PATHSPECS, which are `/`-separated on every platform, not host paths.

 * optional on the read path. A local branch of the same name existing is not a hazard here because this string
 * is unambiguous: git resolves `origin/ops/pr-views` through `refs/remotes/` first, and the fetch immediately
