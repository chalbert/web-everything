 * @description THE HEAVY-COMMAND CONTAINER POOL POC (#3621 sequencing note, tracked on #3383) — runs a heavy
 *   command inside a real Apple `container` CLI instance (Containerization framework, Apple-Silicon-only)
 *   instead of directly on the host, so the cap `we:scripts/readiness/heavy-admission.mjs` already enforces
 *   (currently `DEFAULT_ADMISSION_CAP = 2`, an in-process COUNTING semaphore with no resource boundary behind
 *   it) becomes a real, hypervisor-enforced CPU/memory ceiling rather than a purely cooperative limit that
 *   assumes concurrent heavy commands behave.
 *
 * WHY THIS SLICE, NOW, AHEAD OF PER-LANE CONTAINERS. `we:backlog/3621-real-os-level-resource-isolation-per-dispatched-lane-is-appl.md`'s
 * own 2026-09-11 amendment (live-tested on this machine) named the heavy-command-pool slice as the cheap half
 * of that item's research: `we:scripts/readiness/heavy-admission.mjs` already owns the invocation-time
 * chokepoint, the command needs no auth/billing change (unlike a per-lane container, which would need
 * `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` + `GH_TOKEN` + an ssh key mounted in), and it "answers this item's founding incident
 * directly" (the #3594 busy-spin CPU-runaway incident that opened #3621). That amendment's own estimate:
 * "plausibly 1-2 days for a working first cut." This module IS that first cut — scoped to exactly ONE heavy
 * command (`check:standards`), proven for real on this machine (see the module's own test suite and the PR
 * that introduced this file for the measured evidence), not yet extended to `test:unit`/Playwright.
 *
 * WHAT IS PROVEN, STATED PLAINLY SO A FUTURE READER DOES NOT OVERCLAIM SCOPE:
 *   - `check:standards` runs inside the container and produces the SAME error/warning count as the host run,
 *     given the SAME repo state (verified side-by-side; the one environment-caused difference is a single
 *     warning swap tied to sibling `frontierui`/`plateau-app` checkouts not being mounted in this POC — a
 *     scope gap, not a correctness bug — see `EXTRA_MOUNTS` below for how a future pass would close it).
 *   - The CPU cap is REAL under this exact command: a `--cpus N` container genuinely bounds host CPU draw,
 *     reproducing #3621's own busy-spin containment result (8 unbounded spinners capped to ~2 cores' worth
 *     of host CPU instead of ~8, on this 12-core host).
 *   - `check:standards` needs NO npm dependency that requires a native (darwin-arm64) binding — its actual
 *     import closure is pure JS (`gray-matter`, `markdown-it`) plus `git` (installed into the image; alpine's
 *     base does not ship it). This lets this POC mount the lane's OWN `node_modules` read-only rather than
 *     baking a separate linux-arm64 tree — cheaper than #3621's own `npm ci`-in-container path, but ONLY valid
 *     for commands with this same pure-JS dependency shape. `test:unit` (vitest, esbuild, rollup — all carry
 *     native darwin bindings in this lane's tree) is NOT proven to work this way; #3621's own measured
 *     `MODULE_NOT_FOUND` failure over a host-darwin mount almost certainly still applies there, and extending
 *     coverage to it needs the baked-linux-tree approach #3621 already measured (`npm ci` in-image, ~14s,
 *     mounted apart from the source dirs — see that item's 2026-09-11 amendment for the numbers).
 *   - Git needs to see the SAME alternate-object-database path a lane clone's `.git/objects/info/alternates`
 *     records (an ABSOLUTE host path to the primary checkout, since lane cloning shares objects via
 *     `--reference` — see `we:scripts/lane-pool-paths.mjs`) — so the primary checkout is bind-mounted into the
 *     container at the IDENTICAL absolute path, read-only, alongside the lane's own read-write mount. Without
 *     this, `git merge-base origin/main HEAD` and similar calls fail inside the container (confirmed: this was
 *     the first real failure mode hit while building this POC, before the alternates mount was added).
 *
 * OPT-IN, NOT WIRED AS A DEFAULT. `we:scripts/readiness/heavy-admission.mjs`'s `run` CLI mode gains a
 * `--container` flag (see that file) that swaps its default host `execSync` for {@link execContainerized}
 * from this module. Nothing calls it automatically yet — `verify-lane.mjs`'s own gate execution, and every
 * other existing heavy-command call site, still runs on the host exactly as before. Wiring a default-on path
 * is deliberately left for a follow-up once `test:unit`/Playwright are proven the same way `check:standards`
 * is proven here (see this file's own header for what remains open).
 *
 * ── `test:unit` (vitest) SLICE (#3621 sequencing note, follow-up to the `check:standards`-only POC above) ──
 * This module now ALSO proves `test:unit`. The header above was right that vitest's own closure (esbuild,
 * rollup — see `vite`'s dependency tree) carries native `darwin-arm64` bindings that do not resolve mounting
 * the lane's host-built `node_modules` straight in (a real `MODULE_NOT_FOUND`, confirmed while building this
 * slice) — the pure-JS shortcut above is genuinely `check:standards`-only, not a general pattern. What DOES
 * work, measured end-to-end against this exact repo:
 *   1. Bake a real LINUX-built `node_modules` via `npm ci` inside `node:22-alpine` (see
 *      `container-exec/Containerfile.test-unit-deps`) — no native-build toolchain needed; every native
 *      optionalDependency in this lockfile (esbuild, rollup, swc, lightningcss, sharp, `@parcel/watcher`) ships
 *      a prebuilt `linux-arm64`/`linux-arm64-musl` binary, so `npm ci` completes in ~15-20s with no compiler.
 *   2. Seed a named `container volume` from that baked `/app/node_modules` ({@link DEFAULT_NODE_MODULES_VOLUME}
 *      — see `container-exec/build-test-unit-deps.mjs`, the build/seed helper).
 *   3. At run time, mount the checkout rw at its own path exactly as before, THEN mount the named volume at
 *      `<cwd>/node_modules` ({@link buildContainerRunArgs}'s `nodeModulesVolume` param) — this SHADOWS just
 *      that one subtree (proven empirically: a named-volume mount at a path nested under an existing bind
 *      mount wins for that subtree, and nothing written into it ever touches the host-mounted parent — the
 *      host's own darwin `node_modules` is never read, written, or even visible inside the guest this way).
 *   4. `vitest.config.ts` resolves `@frontierui/plugs`/`@frontierui/webtheme` to the SIBLING `frontierui`
 *      checkout (`resolve(repoRoot, '../frontierui/...')`, `vitest.shared.ts`) — a second real failure mode
 *      hit while building this slice (`Failed to resolve import "@frontierui/plugs/..."`) until that sibling
 *      directory was ALSO bind-mounted read-only at its own identical host path ({@link readSiblingRoot} /
 *      the `extraReadOnlyMounts` param), closing the "sibling-repo mounts aren't included" gap the
 *      `check:standards`-only POC named as open (scoped here to `frontierui`, the only sibling `vitest.config.ts`
 *      itself resolves — `plateau-app` is a `vite.config.mts`/dev-server-only reference, not part of
 *      `test:unit`'s own import graph, so it is deliberately NOT mounted by this slice).
 * Evidence (measured on this machine, see the PR that introduced this section for the full numbers): the SAME
 * 35-file / 441-test subset (`blocks/__tests__`) run on the host and inside this container produced IDENTICAL
 * pass counts. The busy-spin CPU-cap containment result from the `check:standards` POC was independently
 * reproduced under this exact node_modules-volume + sibling-mount configuration (8 unbounded spinners held to
 * ~191-204% aggregate host CPU inside a `--cpus 2` container vs. ~800% unconstrained on the host).
 * NOT proven by this slice: the FULL `test:unit` suite side-by-side (a representative subset was used — see
 * that PR for why), Playwright, and `--container`/baked-deps still are not wired as any default.
