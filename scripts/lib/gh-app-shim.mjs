 * @description #x8mpubm — GET THE APP TOKEN INTO A DISPATCHED SESSION, FOR REAL. The coordinator's live
 *   evidence (2026-09-23) overturned this same item's own first cut: `we:scripts/lib/github-app-auth-env.mjs`
 *   correctly mints/refreshes an App token and sets `process.env.GH_TOKEN` in the DAEMON's own process (review
 *   88701, fix 8004, drain 43551 all had it in `ps eww`) — but the SPAWNED review/fix sessions (pids 72738,
 *   81880) had neither `GH_TOKEN` nor any `WE_GITHUB_APP_*` var at all. `claude --bg` does not fork a simple
 *   child of the invoking process; it hands work to a separate background session mechanism that does not
 *   inherit the SPAWNER's ambient `process.env` — confirmed live here by direct experiment (a `WE_ENV_PROBE_*`
 *   var set on the spawning shell never reached a `--bg` session's own Bash tool subprocess).
 *
 * WHAT DOES REACH IT, ALSO CONFIRMED LIVE (at the time): `claude --bg --settings '{"env":{...}}'` — an EXPLICIT
 * CLI argument, not inherited env — sets exactly those vars in the started session's own Bash-tool subprocess
 * environment, including a `PATH` override (proven by shadowing `gh` with a fake executable and observing the
 * fake, not the real, `gh` respond inside the dispatched session).
 *
 * #x8mpubm FOLLOW-UP (live-caught 2026-09-24, review-2600/2599/2594, after that day's earlier laptop restart):
 * `--settings` STOPPED BEING THE WHOLE STORY. The CLI now keeps a background daemon (`CLAUDE_BG_BACKEND=daemon`)
 * with a pool of pre-warmed, generic "spare" processes it hands a `--bg` request to for low latency, INSTEAD OF
 * spawning fresh, whenever one is available — and `ps eww` on live, task-ASSIGNED review sessions proved the
 * claim never re-applies `--settings`'s env to that spare: every one carried `GH_TOKEN` baked in from whenever
 * the spare was forked (traced to ~34 min after that day's 10:21 ET reboot — long since expired by the time it
 * was used), and the shim dir was simply absent from `PATH`. A `--settings`-only dispatch is thus, empirically,
 * a COIN FLIP: it lands when the pool happens to be out of spares (a genuinely fresh spawn), and silently does
 * nothing the rest of the time. Confirmed live, the SAME day: a `.claude/settings.local.json` `env` block in
 * the checkout the session starts in reaches a dispatched session's `gh` resolution even with NO `--settings`
 * flag at all — read fresh per task rather than baked at process-fork time, so it cannot go stale the way a
 * spare's own exec-time env can. {@link buildGhShimSettingsEnv} now writes BOTH: the `--settings` env object AND
 * (given a `cwd`) this file, so the override reaches a session whichever path served it.
 *
 * WHY A PATH-SHADOWING SHIM, NOT A ONE-TIME `GH_TOKEN` VALUE. Baking the CURRENT cached token into `--settings`
 * at spawn time would suffer the exact expiry problem this item's own evidence names: an installation token
 * lives ~1h, and a dispatched review/fix session can genuinely outlive that (multi-round reviews, a fix that
 * runs tests, retries). An env var, once set on a process, never updates itself no matter how long that
 * process lives. Instead, this shadows `gh` on `PATH` with a wrapper ({@link renderGhShimScript}) that reads
 * `we:scripts/lib/github-app-auth-env.mjs`'s own shared, continuously-refreshed token cache file FRESH ON
 * EVERY `gh` INVOCATION — so a session's very first `gh` call and its five-hundredth, an hour later, each get
 * whatever the daemon fleet's own ongoing refresh has most recently written, never a stale spawn-time snapshot.
 * The wrapper needs no `WE_GITHUB_APP_*` var and never touches the private key itself — only the cache file's
 * already-minted, short-lived token, exactly the credential `GH_TOKEN` was always meant to carry.
 *
 * OPT-IN, SAME GATE AS THE REST OF THIS EPIC (#3866). {@link buildGhShimSettingsEnv} returns `null` — no fs
 * write, no PATH override, a dispatch byte-identical to before this file existed — unless
 * `we:scripts/lib/github-app-auth-env.mjs#resolveGithubAppEnvConfig` says the CALLING process has actually
 * opted into App auth. This is not only architectural tidiness: a process (or a test) that has not configured
 * `WE_GITHUB_APP_*` has no cache worth shadowing `gh` for, so shimming would be pure overhead for zero benefit
 * — and, live-caught the same day on this same item's own status-file follow-up, an unconditional real-fs
 * default is exactly how an unrelated test run ends up writing into a developer's actual home directory.
 *
 * NEVER TOUCHES THE PRIVATE KEY. The generated shim only ever reads the shared token CACHE (a short-lived,
 * already-minted installation token) — never `WE_GITHUB_APP_PRIVATE_KEY_PATH`, never signs a JWT, never mints.
 *
 * PURE CORE / IO SHELL: {@link resolveRealGhBinary}, {@link renderGhShimScript} and {@link ghShimPathOverride}
 * are pure (every input injected, including the filesystem probe). {@link ensureGhShim} is the one real write,
 * best-effort and never-throwing exactly like `github-app-auth-env.mjs#writeStatusFile`. {@link
 * buildGhShimSettingsEnv} composes the three into the one thing a dispatcher actually needs: an `env` object
 * to fold into a `claude --bg --settings` argument, or `null` when nothing should change.
