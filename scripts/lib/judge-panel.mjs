/**
 * judge-panel.mjs — N jurors, spawned at once, awaited as one, budgeted as one (#3050, under #3029).
 *
 * THE LAYER BETWEEN `judgeSpawn` AND A `judge` STEP. `we:scripts/lib/judge-spawn.mjs` (#3028) spawns ONE
 * tool-free juror. `we:scripts/lib/jury-core.mjs` NAMES the fan-out set (`PANEL_LENSES`,
 * `panelRigorForCareLevel` → `lenses` + `jurorsPerLens`) and reduces the verdicts, but spawns nothing. This
 * module is the missing middle and NOTHING ELSE: it takes a roster, runs one `judgeSpawn` per seat
 * concurrently, awaits every one, and hands back the per-juror results together.
 *
 * IT REIMPLEMENTS NOTHING AND RULES NOTHING. No second argv recipe (`buildJudgeArgv`), no second denylist
 * (`assertNoForbiddenArgv`), no second session-id derivation (`deriveSessionId`) and no second seed encoding
 * (`sessionSeed`, #3058) — every one of them is IMPORTED from `judge-spawn.mjs`. And no reduction: `derivePanelVerdict` / `buildPanelFindings` / diversity-selection stay
 * in `jury-core.mjs`, because a second reducer here is precisely the defect that module's `AGGREGATION`
 * constant exists to prevent (#3050 "Not in scope").
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * THE ONE PROPERTY THAT IS THE PRODUCT: PAIRWISE-DISTINCT SIBLINGS.
 *
 * The fan-out that exists today (`we:skills-src/jury/subject-jury.workflow.js`, #2658) uses the Workflow
 * runtime's subagent primitive, and A SUBAGENT INHERITS ITS PARENT'S `CLAUDE_CODE_SESSION_ID` — measured
 * 2026-08-08 in #3006 (parent `01f39b97…`, child `f4386de9…`) and re-measured 2026-08-09 in #3048 (a subagent
 * reported its parent's id byte-for-byte). By the test this repo already keys reviewer identity on
 * (`we:scripts/lib/review-independence.mjs`), that panel is ONE ACTOR WEARING N HATS. A headless spawn is not:
 * #3028 records three spawns whose environment carried the parent's id each reporting a DIFFERENT
 * `session_id`.
 *
 * So this module makes sibling distinctness STRUCTURAL rather than incidental. Every seat gets its own
 * `--session-id`, derived from `runId` + the seat's id, and `panelSeats` self-checks that the derived set is
 * pairwise distinct before anything is spawned. The seat id is `lens#slot` — the SAME convention
 * `materializeRoster` already uses in `jury-core.mjs` — which is what separates the TWO SEATS ON ONE LENS that
 * `panelRigorForCareLevel` produces at care `high` (`jurorsPerLens: 2`). Seeding on the lens alone would
 * collapse those two seats onto one id, i.e. one actor, which is the whole failure being removed.
 *
 * Read the limit honestly, per #2895 and #3028's own header: a distinct session id is NOT an unforgeable actor
 * signal. What it removes is the failure a subagent juror has BY CONSTRUCTION and cannot argue its way out of.
 *
 * WHICH `sessionId` THE RESULT CARRIES, AND WHY. Each result's `sessionId` is the id THIS MODULE DERIVED AND
 * PUT IN THE CHILD'S ARGV — the panel's own record of which actor it seated. `reportedSessionId` is what the
 * child's own stdout echoed back (empty on a failed seat). They are the same value in a real run (`--session-id`
 * is accepted and echoed by `claude` 2.1.220, per #3028's `deriveSessionId` note), and keeping both means a
 * caller can NOTICE if that ever stops being true instead of silently trusting one of them.
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * FOUR REFUSALS, ALL FAIL-CLOSED, ALL BEFORE THE FIRST CHILD STARTS.
 *
 *  1. DEPTH. `depth >= maxDepth` is refused — and so is a `depth` or `maxDepth` that is absent, null, or not a
 *     finite number. Unknown depth is a REFUSAL, not a default, applying the fail-closed principle ratified in
 *     #3013 Fork 2 on 2026-08-09 (*"absent diff ⇒ not routine"*; commit `d84f7cb9`, PR #1127).
 *
 *     STATE THE RISK ACCURATELY, because the obvious version of it is already foreclosed: `buildJudgeArgv`
 *     always emits `--tools ''`, so a juror CANNOT SPAWN ANYTHING AT ALL — no subagent, no second headless
 *     process. Juror-spawns-juror recursion is structurally impossible at the judge step, and this cap is NOT
 *     what prevents it. What the cap governs is the OPERATION nesting one level up: a `judgePanel` invoked from
 *     a context that is itself a panel child, or re-entered through a `compute`/`effect` step of the operations
 *     engine (#3032, resolved 2026-08-09 → `we:scripts/operations/`). There the floor is not natural and the
 *     bill compounds, so depth is an explicit parameter that fails closed rather than an assumption. A caller
 *     that nests a panel passes `depth + 1`.
 *
 *  2. AGGREGATE BUDGET. `judgeSpawn` takes `budget` PER SPAWN (`--max-budget-usd`, default `0.5`). Five jurors
 *     at that cap is five times the bill with nothing watching the total. `maxTotalBudgetUsd` is REQUIRED — an
 *     unset aggregate ceiling is the same fail-open the depth cap rejects — and the sum of the seats' per-juror
 *     budgets is checked BEFORE THE FIRST SPAWN, so a panel that cannot afford its roster bills nothing at all
 *     rather than half a roster.
 *
 *     Its honest limit: this is ADMISSION CONTROL over the DECLARED ceilings, not a live meter. What actually
 *     stops a running juror is its own `--max-budget-usd`, enforced by the CLI. The result reports the observed
 *     `totalCostUsd` so a caller can compare the two, and no claim is made here that the observed total is
 *     policed mid-flight.
 *
 *  3. SYNCHRONOUS BY CONSTRUCTION. The panel AWAITS its children — one promise, resolved only after every seat
 *     has settled. This is deliberately not caller discipline: THERE IS NO DETACH PATH ON THE EXPORTED SURFACE
 *     to get wrong. No `unref`, no `detached`, no handle handed back to poll. The precedent is on the record:
 *     #2833 (resolved 2026-08-02) exists because a build subagent *"launched a check in the background and then
 *     blocked, waiting for a completion signal that never advanced it"*, holding a lane producing nothing until
 *     a person nudged it; its own remedy names this shape — *"or subagents must run their checks
 *     synchronously"*.
 *
 *  4. THE ARGV DENYLIST, PER SEAT, PRE-FLIGHT. Every seat's argv is built and passed through the IMPORTED
 *     `assertNoForbiddenArgv` before ANY child starts, so a `--bare` juror is refused inside a panel exactly as
 *     it is alone — and refused hard: the whole call throws and zero processes start, rather than one seat
 *     failing while its siblings bill. `judgeSpawn`'s own per-child call to the same guard is unchanged and
 *     still in the path; because this module feeds it the identical arguments it already validated, that inner
 *     call is now belt-and-braces from THIS caller and no test here pretends to reach it. (It IS reached and
 *     pinned from the single-spawn path — see `we:scripts/lib/__tests__/judge-spawn.test.mjs`.)
 *
 * ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 * PARTIAL FAILURE IS A RESULT, NOT AN EXCEPTION. One juror rejecting must neither orphan its siblings nor
 * resolve the panel early. Children are collected with `Promise.allSettled`, so the panel still waits for every
 * seat, reports the failed one as `{ ok: false, error }`, and returns the rest. A caller reduces what it got —
 * the reduction lives in `jury-core.mjs`, and deciding what a missing seat means is that reducer's business,
 * not this module's. `judgePanel` therefore throws ONLY for the four admission refusals above, never because a
 * child failed.
 *
 * NO NEW ROUTE FROM CALLER INPUT TO A CHILD'S ARGV (#3056, open). That item records that `buildJudgeArgv`
 * accepts any non-empty `model` string while `FORBIDDEN_ARGV` names only `--bare`, so a flag-shaped option
 * VALUE reaches argv. It is captured there and NOT fixed here — but it is not widened either. Every option this
 * module forwards (`mandate`, `shape`, `model`, `effort`, `budget`) was already a `judgeSpawn` argv input, and
 * this module's OWN new inputs reach argv through exactly one funnel or not at all: `runId`, `lens`, `slot` and
 * `id` go only into `sessionSeed` → `deriveSessionId`, which SHA-256s them into a canonical UUID, and `depth` /
 * `maxDepth` / `maxTotalBudgetUsd` never touch argv in any form. A test pins that with flag-shaped lens and run
 * ids.
 *
 * PURE except `judgePanel`, which spawns subprocesses through the injectable `spawnFn` it forwards to
 * `judgeSpawn` — the same seam the unit tests use, so the whole suite spawns nothing. A LEAF module above
 * `judge-spawn.mjs`: it imports that and nothing else from the review/jury seams.

/**
 * THE PURE SEAM, AND THE PLACE SIBLING DISTINCTNESS IS MADE STRUCTURAL — a roster in, named seats out.
 *
 * Spawns nothing, reads no environment. Each seat gets:
 *   • `slot` — its 1-based index AMONG THE SEATS ON ITS OWN LENS, so a `jurorsPerLens: 2` lens yields slots 1
 *     and 2 rather than two of the same thing. A caller may pin `slot` explicitly.
 *   • `id` — `lens#slot`, the SAME identity string `materializeRoster` mints in `we:scripts/lib/jury-core.mjs`,
 *     so a panel's seats line up with a `roster-picked` ledger event's jurors without a translation table. A
 *     caller may supply `id` outright.
 *   • `sessionId` — `deriveSessionId(sessionSeed([runId, id]))`. Deterministic (the run record can point at
 *     the transcript), and distinct per seat because `id` is distinct per seat. The seed goes through the
 *     IMPORTED `sessionSeed` encoder rather than a join written here: a space join is not injective, so
 *     `("a", "b c#1")` and `("a b", "c#1")` used to name the same actor across two runs (#3058). There is
 *     exactly one seed encoding in the constellation and it lives in `judge-spawn.mjs` — a second one here
 *     would be the same defect wearing a different hat.
 *
 * `runId` IS REQUIRED. `judgeSpawn` alone may fall back to a one-off random seed — still a distinct actor, just
 * not a reproducible name — but recordability is the entire reason a panel is worth owning (#3050), so a panel
 * without a run id is refused rather than silently un-recordable.
 *
 * The pairwise-distinctness self-check at the end is deliberately not just a test's job: it is cheap, and if it
 * ever fires, the module's one product claim has failed and nothing should be spawned.
