/**
 * @file scripts/lib/daemon-self-sync.mjs
 * @description xv6fciw (narrow slice of decision #3681) — keep a daemon's DEDICATED clone on `origin/main`
 *   without a human re-syncing it, and restart the daemon onto new code between ticks.
 *
 * WHY. The review and fix-dispatch daemons run from a dedicated clone. `main` lands PRs every few minutes, so
 * within minutes the clone is behind and every tick refuses every dispatch (`assertMainNotStale`) until someone
 * fetches and merges by hand — done 5+ times on 2026-09-23 alone. The clone is usually also AHEAD (unmerged
 * fixes merged in to run ahead of `main`), so `checkMainStaleness`'s fast-forward never applies; it needs a real
 * merge.
 *
 * WHAT IT DOES, before each tick:
 *   1. fetch `origin/main`;
 *   2. behind + clean tree → `git merge origin/main` (a merge commit); a conflict is aborted, leaving the tree
 *      exactly as it was, and the tick proceeds (it will refuse as it does today — never worse);
 *   3. a dirty tree, or a checkout not on `main`, is never touched;
 *   4. if the merge brought in commits, the daemon's in-memory code is now older than its checkout: the wrapper
 *      calls `onRestart` INSTEAD of ticking — the caller releases its lease and exits 0, and launchd's KeepAlive
 *      starts it again on the new code. That happens between ticks, never mid-dispatch.
 *
 * x3ecgta (Ruling #3681 Fork 4 condition (ii), platform-decisions.md#resident-daemon-reload-lifecycle clause 3)
 * — THE PER-CLONE READER/WRITER LOCK. Several daemons (the review daemon, the fix-dispatch daemon) share ONE
 * clone. Before this, nothing stopped one from self-syncing (merging/aborting) that clone while the other was
 * mid-tick running code loaded from that same tree — the mover's `git merge --abort` on a conflict could even
 * undo a merge the OTHER daemon had just landed. The fix is a per-clone reader/writer lock, built ONLY from the
 * existing atomic-mkdir + heartbeat-TTL + same-host-pid-dead-fast-reclaim primitive in
 * `scripts/readiness/file-locks.mjs` (the same primitive `skills-src/conveyor/runner-lock.mjs` wraps for its own
 * singleton lease) — never a new fs primitive:
 *   - Each tick holds a SHARED "reader" lease ({@link acquireCloneTickLock}/{@link releaseCloneTickLock}) for the
 *     duration of the real tick body (its own `tickOnce`, and whatever children it spawns) — never around the
 *     self-sync measurement itself, which is read-only.
 *   - The one process that actually MOVES the clone (the `git merge`/`git merge --abort` in
 *     {@link selfSyncCheckout}) takes the EXCLUSIVE "writer" lease ({@link acquireCloneMoveLock}/
 *     {@link releaseCloneMoveLock}) — granted only when no reader is live and no other writer already holds it.
 *   - A reader lease is refused while a writer is live (`writer-active`); a writer lease is refused while any
 *     reader is live (`tick-in-progress`) or another writer already holds it (`concurrent-mover`). A refusal is
 *     NEVER treated as a merge conflict — it just skips this tick's move (or this tick entirely), retried next
 *     time; the daemon that lost the tree-move race still restarts once the mover's inputs move, via the
 *     existing boot-input staleness check (clause 2), never by fighting over the same merge.
 *   - Both leases use the SAME heartbeat-TTL + same-host-PID-dead fast reclaim `reserve()`/`reclaimDecision`
 *     already give `file-locks.mjs` callers — a daemon SIGKILLed mid-tick (or mid-move) is reclaimed at once on
 *     this host (mirrors
 *     `runner-lock.mjs`'s #3952 `probeRunnerLeaseLiveness`), never stuck for the full TTL.
 *   - Lock state lives OUTSIDE the git working tree entirely (a fixed HOME-level root, keyed by a hash of the
 *     clone's resolved path — see {@link SELF_SYNC_LOCK_ROOT}), never under `<root>/.claude/locks`: an untracked
 *     file inside the tree would make `git status --porcelain` see the clone as permanently dirty, which is the
 *     EXACT #xvyuwtg bug (an ungitignored daemon log defeated `main-staleness.mjs`'s own clean-tree auto-ff) —
 *     this lock must never reproduce it.
 *   - Accepted residual: the readers-then-writer check in {@link acquireCloneMoveLock} is two separate atomic
 *     mkdirs, not one atomic transaction, so a reader that begins its own acquire in the microsecond window
 *     between the writer's readers-scan and its own mkdir win is a race the filesystem cannot close outright.
 *     The writer immediately re-scans and backs out if it finds one (shrinking the window to microseconds);
 *     doing better needs a single-writer arbiter process this card deliberately does not add — ticks run on the
 *     order of seconds to minutes, so a microsecond window is a reasonable residual, not a rebuild of the
 *     primitive.
 *   - Scope: this lock guards the DEFAULT path only. The POC-mode path ({@link selfSyncCheckoutPoc}) takes
 *     neither lease, so a POC-mode daemon sharing a clone with a default-mode one is NOT protected by it.
 *
 * PURE CORE / IO SHELL: {@link decideSelfSync}, {@link decideTickLockGate} and {@link decideMoveLockGate} are
 * pure; {@link selfSyncCheckout} does the git IO (plus the writer-lease gate around the actual merge) through an
 * injected runner (defaults to `main-staleness.mjs#gitRun`); {@link withSelfSync} wraps a daemon's
 * `runDaemonLoop` effects (plus the reader-lease around the real tick).
 *
 * #3383 — TWO LIVE BUGS FOUND 2026-09-23, BOTH FIXED HERE, BOTH ADDITIVE (every existing caller's behavior is
 * unchanged unless it opts in / the new drift check below is the one exception, see its own note). Both apply
 * only to the DEFAULT (non-POC) path below — see the POC MODE paragraph for why that path stays untouched.
 *
 *   BUG 1 — a multi-repo tick takes long enough (several `gh` calls per repo, several repos) that
 *   `origin/main` moves again AFTER this file's own tick-start sync ran but BEFORE the tick finishes — the
 *   real dispatch chokepoint (`main-staleness.mjs#assertMainNotStale`, called once per repo deep inside the
 *   tick) then refuses that repo outright ("refusing to dispatch... STALE code..."). Before this fix, that
 *   refusal was just absorbed as an ordinary per-repo tick failure and the daemon slept the FULL interval
 *   before trying again — losing the same race next tick too, since main moves every few minutes, well within
 *   a 3-repo tick's own duration (confirmed live: 345 refusal lines, ALL 3 repos on the latest tick). The fix:
 *   `withSelfSync` now accepts an optional `hasStaleRefusal(tickResult)` predicate; when a tick's own result
 *   is flagged, it re-syncs IMMEDIATELY (not waiting for the next scheduled tick) and restarts if that finds
 *   new commits — the same `onRestart` path the tick-start sync already uses. Omitting `hasStaleRefusal`
 *   (every caller that existed before this fix) is byte-identical to today.
 *
 *   BUG 2 — the review-daemon and reconcile-fix-dispatch-daemon run from ONE shared dedicated clone.
 *   Whichever self-syncs first performs the merge and restarts (via the branch above); the OTHER then calls
 *   `selfSyncCheckout` itself, finds `behind: 0` (someone else already brought the checkout current) and,
 *   before this fix, just ticked on — forever, on its own now-stale in-memory module cache, since nothing
 *   about "up-to-date" told it the code underneath it had changed. Confirmed live: the fix-dispatch daemon ran
 *   from 18:09 to ~19:17 on stale code before a human noticed and restarted it by hand. The fix: `withSelfSync`
 *   now records the on-disk HEAD sha once, when the daemon BOOTS (i.e., once, when this function itself is
 *   called to build the effects — before the loop's first tick), and every tick re-reads HEAD and restarts
 *   whenever it no longer matches — regardless of WHICH process (this one, or a sibling sharing the same
 *   clone) moved it. This is unconditional (not behind an option) because it changes nothing for a daemon
 *   running from its OWN clone (its own merges already restart it via the existing branch; nothing else ever
 *   moves its HEAD) and only ever ADDS a restart, never removes one — never a regression, by construction.
 *
 * POC MODE (epic #3383's daemon POC, `we:docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#poc-branch-declared-delivery-mode`,
 * `we:scripts/lib/poc-branches.json`'s `lane/daemon-poc` entry). Setting {@link DAEMON_SELF_SYNC_BRANCH_ENV}
 * (`DAEMON_SELF_SYNC_BRANCH=lane/daemon-poc`) switches a clone's "home" branch from `main` to the named POC
 * branch and, each tick, fetches BOTH `origin/main` AND `origin/<poc>`, merging whichever has commits the
 * clone lacks — same merge-commit-never-rebase-never-push contract as the default path, just against two
 * upstreams instead of one, and the SAME fail-closed/timeout posture the default path already carries (a
 * failed/timed-out probe is never silently read as clean/up-to-date). {@link decidePocSelfSync} /
 * {@link selfSyncCheckoutPoc} carry this; the DEFAULT (env unset) path through {@link decideSelfSync} /
 * {@link selfSyncCheckout} is UNCHANGED — not refactored to share the two-source logic — specifically so the
 * already-shipped, live daemon behavior stays byte-identical rather than riding on a generalization it never
 * asked for. The bug-1/bug-2 fixes above are, for the same reason, ALSO scoped to the default path only —
 * neither review-daemon.mjs nor reconcile-fix-dispatch-daemon.mjs opt into POC mode today.

/**
 * Wrap a daemon's `runDaemonLoop` effects so each tick first self-syncs the clone. When new commits arrive,
 * `onRestart` runs in place of the tick (the caller releases its lease and exits); otherwise the tick runs.
 *
 * x3ecgta (DEFAULT path): the real tick runs under the clone's SHARED reader (tick) lease — the OTHER half of
 * the per-clone reader/writer lock (the merge-side half lives in {@link selfSyncCheckout}). No reader lease is
 * needed on the restart branches, since this process is exiting rather than reading the (now-current) tree.
 * When a writer is actively moving the clone right now, the reader lease is refused (`writer-active`) and this
 * ENTIRE tick is skipped — never partially read a tree mid-move — retried next cycle, same as every other
 * no-worse-than-today self-sync fallback. The lease is released BEFORE the #3383 bug-1 immediate re-sync
 * below, so that re-sync's own writer lease is never refused by this process's own reader.
 *
 * POC mode ({@link resolvePocSyncBranch} resolves non-null, from `pocBranch` or
 * {@link DAEMON_SELF_SYNC_BRANCH_ENV}) routes through {@link selfSyncCheckoutPoc} instead of
 * {@link selfSyncCheckout} — everything else about the wrapper (restart-on-merge, tick-through otherwise,
 * `timeoutMs` forwarding) is identical in shape. The DEFAULT (unset) path below matches
 * {@link selfSyncCheckout}'s own shipped behavior verbatim (plus the two #3383 fixes next), so it stays
 * byte-identical for every daemon that does not opt in.
 *
 * #3383 bug 2 (unconditional on the DEFAULT path, see file header): the on-disk `HEAD` sha is recorded once,
 * right now, when this function builds the wrapped effects (i.e., at the daemon's own boot, before
 * `runDaemonLoop`'s first tick). Every tick re-reads it; if it no longer matches — this process's OWN merge
 * (the branch below), a SIBLING process sharing the same clone having already merged, or a human's own
 * `git merge`/`pull` — this process's in-memory code no longer matches the checkout on disk, so it restarts
 * too, regardless of who moved it.
 *
 * #3383 bug 1 (opt-in via `hasStaleRefusal`, DEFAULT path only, see file header): when the wrapped tick's OWN
 * result shows it hit the stale-main refusal mid-tick, re-sync immediately and restart if that finds new
 * commits, instead of waiting out the full `intervalMs` to lose the same race again. A caller that omits
 * `hasStaleRefusal` (every caller that existed before this option) is byte-identical to before.
