## Plan: Create Web Everything Website

I will set up the "Web Everything" project using the provided portfolio repository as a structural template. The site will be a colorful, "funky" hub for web standardization subprojects, featuring progress meters and detailed project pages.

### Steps
1. Analyze the [portfolio](../portfolio) template to identify the tech stack (e.g., Astro, React, Vite) and build scripts.
2. Analyze [TypeScript](../TypeScript) to extract "Web Injectors" syntax and goals for content generation.
3. Initialize [webeverything](../webeverything) by replicating the [portfolio](../portfolio) boilerplate and directory structure.
4. Implement the Home page listing all subprojects (Webplugs, Web candies, etc.) with mission statements.
5. Create a `ProjectStatus` component to visualize the "Concept" → "POC" → "Complete" lifecycle.
6. key pages for each subproject using the "funky" design language and content derived from instructions.
7. Apply global standard styles (CSS/Theme) to match the requested innovative/tongue-in-cheek aesthetic.

### Further Considerations
1. **Critical:** I cannot strictly access `/portfolio` or `/TypeScript` yet. Please **Add Folder to Workspace** for both so I can read files.
2. Should the "Web Injectors" page link back to the TypeScript repo or host the documentation directly?
3. Do you have a specific color palette in mind for the "funky" theme, or should I propose one?
