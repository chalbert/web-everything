   <p>The <strong>Web Blocks</strong> project aims to establish a set of standard protocols for interoperable
      modules—both visual components and behavioral traits. By focusing on the <em>protocol</em> rather than the
      implementation, we ensure that parts from different libraries can work together to provide consistent UX and
      accessibility.</p>
   <p>This initiative defines the "how it works" and "how it communicates" portion of web development, leaving the "how
      it looks" to the implementer.</p>
