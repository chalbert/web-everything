<p>
    Patches <code>cloneNode</code> to properly preserve Custom Elements, Custom Comments, and Custom Text Nodes during cloning operations.
</p>

<h4 id="what-it-preserves">What it Preserves</h4>
<ul class="list-disc ml-5 mb-4 text-sm text-gray-600">
    <li><strong>Custom Elements:</strong> Reconstructs elements using their constructor with original options</li>
    <li><strong>Custom Comments:</strong> Preserves comment behavior prototypes and options</li>
    <li><strong>Custom Text Nodes:</strong> Maintains parser information and reactive bindings</li>
    <li><strong>Undetermined Nodes:</strong> Preserves upgrade state for nodes awaiting parser determination</li>
</ul>

<p class="text-sm text-gray-600 mt-4">
    Without this patch, cloned nodes would lose their enhanced prototypes and revert to native HTML elements, comments, and text nodes.
