      <strong>Web States</strong> standardizes how state is managed, observed, and validated in the browser.
      By elevating Stores, Signals, and Schemas to first-class primitives, we decouple state logic from UI frameworks.

   <h3>Design Note: Observation as a Web States Role</h3>
   <p>
      <strong>Observation</strong>—the ability to subscribe to changes or react to updates—is a core feature of <em>Web
         States</em> (such as stores or signals). These objects are designed to be observed directly, regardless of how
      they are provided (e.g., via injection or direct reference). Context/injector systems simply provide access to
      these stateful objects; the observation mechanism is always a property of the state object itself.
