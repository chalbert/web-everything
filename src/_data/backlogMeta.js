// backlogMeta — the single source of truth for the backlog badge VOCABULARY (colours, labels, tooltips)
// shared by every surface that renders a backlog item: the /backlog/ tile + Prioritisation table
// (src/backlog.njk) and the /backlog/{id}/ detail page (src/backlog-pages.njk). The badge MACROS that
// consume this live in src/_includes/backlog-badges.njk (imported by both templates); keeping the data
// here — not duplicated inline in each .njk — is what stops the two surfaces from drifting (the bug this
// file fixes: a `preparing`/`program` colour added to one surface but not the other). Pure data, no logic.
//
// Dogfood note: these badges map to the FUI `badge` / `filter-chip` components in the #778 inventory; the
// #777 chrome-rework will swap the macros' internals to render via those FUI components (Mode-C, #765),
// at which point this vocabulary becomes the component's props. One seam, by design.
