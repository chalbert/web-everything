**A subagent (or any agent) that kicks off a long-running gating check — a test suite, `verify-lane`,
a CI/merge poll, anything whose completion decides the next step — must not end its turn assuming
something will wake it up later, unless it is specifically a Task/Agent-type background job the
harness itself tracks (that does generate a real completion notification).** A backgrounded Bash
command, or an ad hoc "I'll check back," generates no such notification.

**Why:** hit live 2026-09-04, across one long session on epic #3383. FOUR separate subagents were
dispatched to do real work (land a PR, author a memory note, extract a skill, fix a bug), each
involving a gating step — `verify-lane`, a merge-status poll, a background check. In every one of
the four cases, the subagent ran the gating step via a backgrounded Bash call (or delegated it to a
further nested subagent) and then ended its own turn with language like "I'll wait for the
background task notification before continuing" — but no such notification exists for a subagent's
own backgrounded Bash command or a nested child it isn't tracking as a live background agent. The
orchestrating session had to notice each stall (sometimes only because the user pointed out "seems
to have stopped"), then explicitly resume each one with a message telling it to check state
directly instead of waiting. Same failure shape, four times in a row — a systemic gap in how
subagents reason about backgrounding, not a one-off.

**How to apply:**
1. Run the gating command (test suite, `verify-lane`, a CI/merge poll) in the FOREGROUND and block on
   its actual completion within the same turn — this is the default.
2. If backgrounding is genuinely necessary (the command is very long), actively poll it yourself in
   a loop within your own turn rather than ending the turn early.
3. If ending the turn is truly unavoidable, say so EXPLICITLY — "I am stopping mid-task and need to
   be resumed with a follow-up message" — never imply a notification will arrive on its own.
4. When authoring an Agent-tool/Task-tool prompt that asks a subagent to run a multi-step pipeline
   ending in a gate (verify-lane, tests, a review/merge wait), instruct it up front: run gating
   checks in the foreground; do not end your turn on a passive wait; if you must background
   something, poll it yourself before ending your turn. Standing practice for any Agent-tool dispatch
   that involves a build/verify/land pipeline, not just this one instance.
