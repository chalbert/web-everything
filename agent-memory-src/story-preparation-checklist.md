**Never hand a story to a builder — human or agent — until the card carries all of this.** Scoping alone is
not preparation. Operator correction, 2026-08-13, after I dispatched scope-only briefs: *"be sure to prepare
items correctly before starting — review size, task, acceptance criteria, design, protocol and interfaces,
anything that a story should have."*

1. **`scope:` including CONSUMERS.** Not only the file being changed. Find them two ways: ES importers, AND
   subprocess callers (`node scripts/x.mjs …`, `execFileSync`, hooks, npm scripts). In this repo the second
   set is usually the bigger one — `we:scripts/lane-pool.mjs` has ten-plus consumers and **not one** is an
   import, so an import-only grep finds zero.
2. **`size`**, Fibonacci, with its basis stated. `> 8` is not a size, it is an instruction to slice — name
   the slices and the seam rather than forcing a number.
3. **Acceptance criteria** — a `## Done when` list of TESTABLE statements. "The guard works" is not one; the
   observable condition that proves it is. If none can be stated testably, that is a finding about the card.
4. **The decided design** — an approach, not a menu. A real fork must be NAMED as an open decision, never
   picked silently and never split away: a buried fork handed to a builder is exactly what the split rubric
   refuses.
5. **Interfaces and protocol at every seam** — real signatures, argument and return shapes, the invocation
   form if it is shelled, what an error looks like, and how existing data migrates. **This is the omission
   that has cost the most review rounds.**
6. **Tasks** — the ordered steps a builder would take.
7. **Delivery shape** — can it land incrementally behind `main`, or must it land as one piece (needing a
   branch)? Say which, and why.

**Why:** items surveyed against what their PRs actually had to touch burned 2–6 review rounds each, and the
gaps were card-level omissions rather than coding mistakes — #3090 (size 1, 2 files declared, touched a
caller that was not in scope) and #3091 (four call sites had to honour one discipline; reviewers found them
one at a time over six rounds). #3071 is the counter-example and belongs in the list: its scope was exactly
right and the work was still pointless, because nothing had measured whether it would unblock anything.
Preparation is where that cost is paid or avoided.

**A correction, kept because it is the same defect this checklist exists to prevent.** The first version of
this entry also cited *"#3084 — 3 files declared, ~20 touched"*. **That is false.** #3084 touched exactly its
three declared files plus its own card (`git diff --name-only 227eef7c^1 227eef7c`). The "~20" was GitHub's
`changedFiles` count against a stale `baseRefOid` after the drain rebased that lane — a number read off a UI,
used as evidence, and propagated into two artifacts without being checked against the diff. **Never cite a
file count from a PR page; derive it from the commit range.** An independent review caught it.

**8. De-risk the risky part DURING preparation, not during the build.** Where an approach could be wrong in
a way that only shows up late, spend the cheap probe up front: measure the blast radius, mutate the guarded
line, revert the code under a test and see if it still passes. Measured on 2026-08-14 — every preparation
told to *verify its own card's claim first* changed the outcome, and the one time prep skipped that step
shows what it costs. #2967's prep proved both gaps live by mutation and found the second was already
shipping at two call sites, not hypothetical. #2996's prep reverted the code under a "regression test" and
watched it pass anyway. **#3015 is the counter-example, not another success**: its prep did NOT measure the
pattern set, and its build had to correct that — measuring **1,276 of 3,319 files** and retiring three
families *beyond what the prep had planned*, "BEYOND what this card planned" in the build's own words. That
correction is exactly the move this item asks prep to make earlier; #3015 shows the cost of not making it
then. Each of the other two cost one probe and removed a whole review round. **A POC belongs in preparation
when the risk is that the approach is wrong; it belongs nowhere at all once the approach is known.**

**9. A prepared card is NOT trustworthy until the preparation itself has been independently reviewed — the
same discipline code gets, not a lighter one.** Measured on 2026-08-14: seven cards were prepared (design
decided, interfaces cited, acceptance written) and merged with NO independent review, on the reasoning that a
backlog-only text change is "just docs" and low-risk. It is not. **All seven, independently reviewed after the
fact, had real defects** — not style notes, defects that would have produced a passing build against a broken
plan:

- **#3004 and #3095 — the design was a PROVABLE NO-OP.** #3004's proposed guard was wired to derive from the
  exact same inputs that already excluded the failing case from the set it checked — the two sets were
  disjoint by construction, so no test could ever catch it: green forever, zero effect on production. #3095's
  design looked up a dispatched build's PR by a branch name that dispatch entries never record — the lookup
  could only ever return empty.
- **#2803 — the premise was built on a fact the repo had moved past.** Two of its four design decisions
  assumed resolve happens in the producing lane pre-merge; the drain has owned that flip since #2748 landed
  (2026-07-28, ~2.5 weeks before this review — not the drain's own six-week age, which the first draft
  conflated with the resolve-ownership date). A
  guard reasoned from the wrong moment is not almost-right, it fires at the wrong time or not at all.
- **#2351 — a wrong mechanism would have silently disabled the feature.** It picked a lock key that turned out
  to be the resident drain daemon's own whole-process lock, and assumed a hook fires once at session end when
  it actually fires after every turn. Built as written: the memory-save hook either never lands (lock
  contention) or blocks the drain for 15 minutes.
- **#2842 — an unnamed blast-radius risk.** The proposed statute-lint rule would fail `check:standards`
  repo-wide the moment anyone resolved one of three specific in-flight items — including one expected to
  resolve soon. Nobody had asked "what does this break for someone doing unrelated work."
- **#2787 and #3063 — a missed consumer, and a catch drawn too wide.** #2787 named one print site for a bug
  that had two; the second was live on `main`, printing the bug and its own correction on adjacent lines.
  #3063's proposed fix would have caught three call sites that don't need catching, breaking an
  already-passing test and doubling real spend (a metered judge re-run) on an operator typo.

**Every one of these maps onto the existing risk taxonomy** (`backlog/3103-*.md`: premise, blast-radius,
consumer, interface, population, decorative-guard, unmeasured-impact, legibility) — which is exactly the
point: risk assessment during preparation and independent review of preparation are the same discipline
aimed at the same failure modes, and neither substitutes for the other. Self-verification (the preparer
re-checking their own claim) caught real things earlier tonight (item 8), but it did not catch any of these
seven — the preparer is structurally the wrong person to catch a mistake in their own reasoning, same as a
builder is the wrong person to accept their own PR.

**Apply item 9 as its own gate:** treat "prepared" and "build-ready" as different states. A card is prepared
when it carries items 1–8. It is build-ready only after an independent reviewer has produced a confidence
level (High / Medium / Low) and a named risk list against it — the same headless, independently-sessioned
review this repo already requires for code (`we:docs/agent/delivery-loop.md`), run against the card instead
of a diff. Do not start a build against a card that only has the first half.

**How to apply (items 1–8):** manual discipline until it becomes the `prepare-story` operation (epic #3099). Its
first slice — a script flagging importers missing from a `scope:` — was built, reviewed twice and **stood
down** (#3098): in a repo whose scripts shell each other rather than import, a static ESM import scan reads
the wrong graph, and its confident all-clear was baseless 74% of the time it fired. So item 1 above is done
by hand, and the epic is a record of what was tried rather than a ranked plan.
Grounding rule: cite `path:line` actually opened, never invent an interface
you have not read — **an honest open question beats a confident wrong contract.** Governed by #2607
(deterministic core, thin judgment): whatever part a script can decide belongs in `we:scripts/readiness/`,
not in an agent's recall. Note #3071's lesson too — a perfect scope does not make work worth doing; if
nothing has measured that the change unblocks something, that is its own preparation gap.
