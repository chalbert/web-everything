# Heavy-command queue: gate the site build, browser tests and raw vitest runs

Commands that load the machine but skip the queue: the eleventy site build (npm run build), the browser tests (playwright / smoke), plain npm test (vitest), and direct npx vitest run from a session. On the prototype, test:unit and check:standards in we:package.json are also still raw (main already wraps them, xaipsbs). Wrap each in we:scripts/readiness/heavy-admission.mjs run in we:package.json, and extend the we:scripts/guard-bash.mjs raw-heavy-command check so a session's direct vitest / playwright / eleventy call is routed through the queue (a single targeted test file stays allowed if its cost is small — decide the threshold from measured timings and record it). Prototype work under #3383: build on lane/mechanical-dispatcher and commit there (no PR, one tracker note per push); the card lives on main; it reaches main through graduation slice #3916 (heavy-admission) or #3917 (dispatch-plan), whose merge notes must union it. Operator ask 2026-09-23: queue many stories and let the AI progress, but limit how many heavy commands run at once. Observed 2026-09-23 on the laptop: load average about 60 on 12 cores with the admission cap at 2.
