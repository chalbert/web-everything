# Lane leases outlive their work: a refused acquire, a finished worker with a purpose-named session, and abandoned dirty lanes all starve the pool

FOUND 2026-09-21. Four lanes stayed leased to finished sessions and about 40 more sat dirty from abandoned claim flips and scratch files, so list --acquirable showed almost nothing. Two of the code defects are already filed (#3407 refused acquire keeps the lease; #3669 leases of finished sessions are not reaped); this card holds what neither covers: the standing recovery for the two safe dirty classes and the worker-side release. The operator ruled on 2026-09-21 in #3817: build (d), the janitor, with the four forks as recorded there. The card is now buildable.

## Evidence (2026-09-21, re-checked against main `a4ff83ea6`)

- What happened today: lane-35 (an aborted `prepare-3746-and-3753`), lane-51 (`build-3468`, its PR long landed) and lanes 65 and 68 (`fix-pr-2392-c`, whose acquire attempts were REFUSED yet left a lease) stayed leased to finished sessions. Separately, `list --acquirable` listed almost nothing usable while about 40 lanes sat dirty from abandoned claim flips and scratch files. Those lanes were recycled by hand; the salvage folder (`lane-salvage`, under the operator's `.operations` directory) holds 70 entries, a directory plus a `.patch` per lane, stamped from 2026-09-21 12:25 EDT. NOT verified here: the four historical lease records themselves, because they were recycled before this card was written. What was checked is the session-name grammar and the code path, below. Today `list --acquirable` shows 42 lanes.
- Refused acquire keeps the lease. `tryClaimLane` (we:scripts/lane-pool.mjs:864) writes the lease marker at the explicit-lane call site (:1101; the auto-pick call site is :1175) BEFORE the #3390 refusal (:1133-1138) and the #2924 refusal (:1218-1223), and `fail()` (:768) exits with no rollback. The first filing worker confirmed today that after such a refusal the marker was still on disk and `list --acquirable` showed nothing for a one-lane pool. I re-read the code and the line numbers above hold; I did not re-run that repro (the repo's push hook blocked scratch-repo setup, see the sibling card on `--adopt`).
- A finished worker with a purpose-named session is never reaped. Re-run today on main: `itemNumFromSession` (we:scripts/conveyor/lease-reaper.mjs:119, over `matchSessionSlug` :113) returns `null` for `prepare-3746-and-3753`, `build-3468`, `fix-pr-2392-c` and this filing's own `file-orchestration-bugs`; it returns `3779` for `conveyor-3779` and `fix-3779`, and `null` for a hash id (`conveyor-3095`). `sessionGoneForLease` (we:scripts/conveyor/lease-reaper.mjs:345) returns `null` for a name outside that grammar (:347), so the session-gone axis never fires. The pool reaper `reapDeadLeasesInPool` (we:scripts/lane-pool.mjs:952) reaps only on a PR-terminal signal and only when `isLeaseStale` (:995, default 240 minutes, we:scripts/lib/lane-lease.mjs:35 and :46) holds and an item number parses. So a purpose-named worker's lease lives its full four hours.

## Relation to the open cards (read today)

- **#3407** ("refused #3390/#2924 acquire guards leave the lease reassigned to the failed requester", filed 2026-08-30): the SAME defect as the refused-acquire half here. It is still open and its line numbers (1044, ~1108) are stale; today they are the ones above. This card must not duplicate that fix; it should rely on #3407 for it.
- **#3669** ("Lane leases held by already-dead PIDs were not reclaimed automatically", filed 2026-09-13): the SAME defect class as the finished-worker half. Its own first hypothesis is exactly this: two leases carried a purpose-only session (`merge-mechanical-dispatcher-main`) that `itemNumFromSession` cannot parse. Today's four sessions confirm that hypothesis (the grammar check above). It is open and unbuilt, so its fix, extended to purpose-named sessions, covers this half.
- **#3657** ("lane-pool acquire's ensureDeps leaks npm ci's inherited stdout into the captured lane path"): NOT the same defect. It is about npm's output corrupting the path that `acquire` prints, and has nothing to do with leases.
- What neither card covers, and what this card is for: (1) a standing recovery for the two safe dirty classes (a lane dirty only by a one-line claim flip, and a lane holding only known scratch files), with salvage first; (2) the worker side: whether a worker's own brief must end with a `release`.

## The design choice (ruled in #3817, 2026-09-21)

- **(a) Release the lease on a refused acquire.** This is #3407. Small and local.
- **(b) Reap a lease whose holder session has finished**, in the session reaper or in `list --acquirable`. This is #3669, extended to purpose-named sessions. Needs a liveness signal for a session that has no item number: the `claude agents` listing, or a heartbeat.
- **(c) Worker briefs end with a release.** Cheapest, but it depends on the model remembering, and the failure above happened exactly when a worker was stopped or refused mid-task. Belt and braces only.
- **(d) A janitor operation for the two safe dirty classes**, run standing or on demand: salvage first (the same patch-plus-directory format the salvage folder uses), then clean and release. Refuses any lane with real uncommitted work. This is the piece nothing else builds.

**Ruled (#3817):** (a) and (b) ship as the fixes of #3407 and #3669, not here; this card builds (d), with (c) added to worker briefs as belt and braces. The safe dirty classes are a closed list kept in one module. The janitor runs automatically from the runner tick when the count of acquirable lanes falls below a floor (one named constant, value chosen in this build); it stays runnable by hand.

**Invariant (ruled, #3817):** a lease that is live and not stale blocks any destructive lane operation. A lane dirty only by a one-line claim flip is also exactly how a LIVE worker's lane looks early in its work (it has just claimed an item and flipped the status line), so "looks like a claim flip" cannot be the janitor's only test; lease liveness has to be checked first, and the same rule has to hold for every option (a) to (d), not just the janitor. The independent review of PR #2400 raised this. Ruled: "live and not stale" is exactly `isLeaseStale` (we:scripts/lib/lane-lease.mjs) returning false. Destructive operations are: at least reset, clean, salvage-then-clean, release, and re-lease to another session.

## Done when

Written for the ruled option (d) (#3817, 2026-09-21).

1. **Executable** — `npx vitest run lane-janitor` passes. The new suite builds a temp pool with three lanes: (i) dirty only by a one-line claim flip, (ii) dirty only by a known scratch file, (iii) holding real uncommitted work. It runs the new janitor verb and asserts that (i) and (ii) are salvaged first (a patch and a directory exist in a temp salvage folder), cleaned, and appear in `list --acquirable`, while (iii) is left byte-for-byte untouched, is not acquirable, and is named in the verb's output. Fails today: no such verb exists.
2. **Executable** — `npx vitest run lane-pool` and `npx vitest run lease-reaper` stay green.
3. **Executable** — the same `lane-janitor` suite has a named case, **`leaves a lane with a live, non-stale lease untouched, and recycles the same lane once the lease is stale`**, with this exact fixture: a temp pool with two lanes, one that looks like a claim flip (class (i): dirty only by a one-line status flip in a backlog card) and one that looks like scratch files (class (ii): dirty only by a known scratch file), each holding a lease that is live and not stale (a fresh timestamp well inside the stale window, held by a session name the janitor does not recognise as finished). Before the janitor pass, record each lane's working-tree state (`git status --porcelain` plus a hash of every dirty file's bytes) and the raw bytes of its lease file. Run the janitor verb. Assert, for both lanes, that the working-tree state and the lease file are byte-identical to what was recorded, that nothing new appears in the temp salvage folder, and that neither lane is in `list --acquirable`. Then age each lease past the stale window (rewrite its timestamp; touch nothing else), run the janitor verb again, and assert that both lanes are now salvaged first (a patch and a directory in the salvage folder), cleaned, released, and appear in `list --acquirable`. Fails today: no such verb exists; and once the verb exists it fails on any implementation that ignores lease liveness, which the class (i)/(ii)/(iii) case in item 1 alone would not catch.
4. **Executable** — `npm run check:standards` reports 0 errors.
5. **Executable** — the `lane-janitor` suite has a named case, **`runs the janitor from the runner tick only when acquirable lanes fall below the floor`**: a temp pool with the floor passed in explicitly (not read from the default constant). With the acquirable count at or above the floor, one tick leaves every dirty lane untouched and the salvage folder empty; with the count below the floor, one tick salvages, cleans and releases the two safe dirty classes and leaves the real-work lane untouched. Fails today: no such tick step exists.
