# Proposal: two review-lens rules from PR #2392 (a header "never"/"still refused" claim needs a named test; a state-matrix check needs one test per cell)

FOUND 2026-09-21. The review of PR #2392 found two untested guards by mutation probe (the assertReady race re-check and the deleted-branch refusal in we:scripts/operations/handoff-home.mjs), and each finding asked for a lens rule: any never or still refused claim in a file header needs a named test for that exact line, and a state-matrix check needs one test per cell. Design-first, UNCLEARED, a proposal only: it changes a review prompt, so it needs the operator's OK before any build. Do not build, and do not queue, until the operator says so.

## Evidence

- The review is the "✅ review — accepted" comment on PR #2392 (recorded 2026-09-21T17:43:50Z, reviewed sha `b50927b78604f08bc62931f045c3266ed6706908`). It is the second comment, not the last: the last one is now the drain's "Merge trace", so the command in the original brief (`.comments[-1]`) no longer returns it. This card reads the review's own text; the mutation probes below are the review's, not re-run by this filing (running them means editing a source file, which this filing did not do).
- Its findings, each with the rule it asked for:
  - `assertReady` race guard untested. Probes: body replaced with `void 0`, all 14 tests in we:scripts/operations/__tests__/handoff-home.test.mjs still green; the whole `throw diverged` line deleted, all 24 tests (that file plus the transport's) still green. Prevention line: "add a review-lens rule that any 'still refused' or 'never' claim in a header needs a named test for that exact line".
  - The refusal to recreate `ops/handoff` when the branch is gone from origin but the working copy has history, untested. Probe: `if (!tip && head) {` replaced by `if (false) {`, all 24 tests green. The "never pulled" test covers only the opposite cell (`tip && !head`). Prevention line: "add a rule that a state-matrix check must have one test per cell".
- Where the claims and guards sit on main today (`a4ff83ea6`): the header claim is at we:scripts/operations/handoff-home.mjs:14-29 (lines 21-23 say the `assertReady` hook re-checks the tip so a racing push "is still refused rather than written over"); the deleted-branch guard is at :209-211; the `assertReady` guard is at :224-226. The review cited :196, :210 and :226; the file has moved a little since.
- Both untested-guard findings were raised by the SECURITY lens's juror, and the correctness lens raised a neighbouring test-coverage finding on the same guard. The correctness lens already carries the bar "every changed branch is exercised, and no test is missing, weakened, or gamed to pass" (`LENS_EXPECTATIONS`, we:scripts/lib/review-core.mjs:1886). So this proposal does not add a new bar; it adds the two concrete methods a juror needs to apply the existing one.
- Where a rule would live: `LENS_HUNT_BRIEF` (we:scripts/lib/review-core.mjs:1904, read by `huntBriefForLens` :1931 and used at :1108) has exactly one entry today, for `claim-accuracy`. A correctness entry would be the second. Lens names: `MANDATE_LENSES` (we:scripts/lib/jury-core.mjs:1107). One-line charters: `REVIEW_LENS_CHARTER` (we:scripts/lib/jury-ledger.mjs:149; correctness reads "find logic errors, broken behaviour, and unhandled cases in the diff"). The existing brief test (we:scripts/lib/__tests__/review-core.test.mjs:1792) asserts every `LENS_HUNT_BRIEF` key is a panel lens and non-empty.

## Related open cards (read today), distinct or overlapping

- #3280 (an "X already handles this" claim must line-cite): same file, different rule. It extends `LENS_EXPECTATIONS` rather than the hunt brief. Its line reference (we:scripts/lib/review-core.mjs:1847) is stale: `LENS_EXPECTATIONS` is at :1885 today.
- #2860 (`check:standards` gate: a test whose TITLE claims a refusal must assert the throw): different. It gates test titles, not header claims.
- #2967 (two `check:standards` rules a PR #1064 review named; status `active`): same family, different rules.

## The design choice (needs the operator's OK)

- **(1) A `LENS_HUNT_BRIEF` entry for the correctness lens only** (prompt text). The juror must ground each "never" / "still refused" header claim by naming the test that reddens when that line is removed, by mutation probe, and must expect one test per cell of a state matrix. Cheap; reuses the mechanism `claim-accuracy` already uses; changes a review prompt.
- **(2) Also a deterministic `check:standards` rule** linking a header claim to a named test. No prompt change, but blocked: a header "never" claim has no machine-readable form today, so the rule needs a header-claim grammar first.
- **(3) Do nothing** and rely on the mutation-probe habit that found these two gaps. Costs nothing; the gaps were found only because one reviewer ran the probe.
- Sub-question: put the rules in the correctness brief, or fold them into #3280 so the correctness lens is edited once? Also: should the security lens carry its own copy, since its juror raised two of the three findings?

**Proposed default: (1)**, correctness lens, folded with #3280 if the operator prefers one edit. Reason: option (2) has no grammar to gate on, and (3) leaves the gap this review found open.

## Further evidence (2026-09-21)

The review of PR #2400 (recorded 2026-09-21, reviewed sha `31a400872ffe0b4e57346c57a4fadf43d7676662`, verdict "prevention outstanding") produced exactly the same class of finding on two cards, this time in backlog cards rather than in a source-file header: a "must use X rather than Y" or "never" sentence in a card's fix section, with no Done-when case that fails under the wrong choice.

- #3814 (filed as `x9vriie`; `acquire --lane=N --branch=<pr-branch>` refuses a clean lane as "ahead"): the fix section says the check must use the live `ls-remote` snapshot rather than stale local remote-tracking refs, but none of the three Done-when cases would fail if the fix used stale local refs. An implementation on stale refs would pass all three and silently discard a commit pushed to a since-deleted branch. Judged by the security lens, `PLAUSIBLE`, spec-only.
- #3815 (filed as `xer3jlp`; lane leases outlive their work): the proposed janitor recycles lanes "dirty only by a one-line claim flip", which is also how a live worker's lane looks early in its work. The only guard, "never removes a lane whose lease is live and not stale", was prose in Done-when item 2 with no test. An implementation that ignores lease liveness would pass every listed test. Judged by the security lens, `CONFIRMED`, spec-only.
- Both findings were spec-only: the cards' tests are unbuilt, so the reviewer could not run a mutation probe; the gap was found by reading the card. The two cards were amended afterwards with a named case each (a stale-tracking-ref fixture on #3814, a live-lease fixture on #3815).

**The rule this suggests, worded for cards:** every "must not", "must use X rather than Y" and "never" sentence in a card's fix section or Done-when needs a Done-when case, named and with its exact fixture, that fails under Y (the wrong choice the sentence rules out). The card should also say that the case fails under Y, so a reviewer can check the claim by reading. This is the card-side twin of this proposal's first rule (a "never" or "still refused" claim in a file header needs a named test for that exact line), and it belongs in the same review-lens brief, since one juror applies both.

The PR #2400 review itself notes that a deterministic gate is not feasible, because these sentences are prose with no machine-readable form. So this is a review-lens rule, not a `check:standards` check: it strengthens the case for option (1) over option (2) above. It adds no new option, and it does not change the proposed default.

Nothing is built and this card stays uncleared: it still needs the operator's OK.

## Done when

Written for the proposed default (1). NOT to be built until the operator says so.

1. **Executable** — `npx vitest run review-core` passes with a new case asserting that `huntBriefForLens('correctness')` is non-empty and contains both rules (the named phrases "still refused" and "one test per cell"), and that the correctness entry of `REVIEW_LENS_CHARTER` (we:scripts/lib/jury-ledger.mjs:149) is unchanged. Fails today: `huntBriefForLens('correctness')` returns the empty string.
2. **Executable** — `npx vitest run review-core jury-core jury-ledger` stays green (the every-key-is-a-panel-lens check at we:scripts/lib/__tests__/review-core.test.mjs:1792 covers the new entry).
3. **Executable** — `npm run check:standards` reports 0 errors.
