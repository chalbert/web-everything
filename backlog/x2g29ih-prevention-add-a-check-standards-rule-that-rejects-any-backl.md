# Prevention — Add a check:standards rule that rejects any backlog card with status open or ready whose Done-when sect… (from chalbert/web-everything#3598 review)

Filed mechanically ON APPROVAL (operator rule, 2026-09-27 — "prevention outstanding should be filed by default on approval") — this accept verdict named the guard(s) below as owed. None of them blocked the approval; the debt is tracked here instead:

1. `we:backlog/xidr1cl-the-drain-restores-ready-to-merge-on-an-accepted-green-merge.md:16` — Add a check:standards rule that rejects any backlog card with status open or ready whose Done-when section still contains the literal 'TODO:' placeholder.
2. `we:backlog/xidr1cl-the-drain-restores-ready-to-merge-on-an-accepted-green-merge.md:14` — Add a review-lens checklist item for cards that add automatic label restoration: list every legitimate way the label is removed and say how each is distinguished. Back it with a test that a PR with an intentional removal is not restored.
3. `we:backlog/xidr1cl-the-drain-restores-ready-to-merge-on-an-accepted-green-merge.md:18` — A write-gate in check:standards that rejects a backlog card entering status open or ready while it still contains a 'TODO:' Done-when line, and requires two Must lines when the card text says it loosens or removes a refusal.

Idempotency key (do not edit): approval-prevention-key:chalbert/web-everything#3598@8c2dbd3d6a2c77d6843ddce205bbdb4cd4a123c5

## Done when

1. **Executable** — TODO: a command that fails before this item lands and passes after.

Hint: a card that loosens a refusal needs two Must lines — what happens on error (refuse), and every input kind besides source code (docs, config, data) that the loosening must still treat cautiously.
