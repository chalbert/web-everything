# Route accepted feedback suggestions into the learnings intake

Route a suggestion the owner accepted on the review screen into the learnings intake (red-team then lane then PR), the multi-tenant generalization of the single-tenant close-session sweep survivors path (we:scripts/conveyor/close-session-sweep.mjs) into the memory intake (we:scripts/memory-reflect.mjs) and the lane-to-PR transport (we:scripts/pr-land.mjs). Mostly greenfield glue over existing machinery; blockedBy the owner-review slice since it acts on reviewed and accepted items.
