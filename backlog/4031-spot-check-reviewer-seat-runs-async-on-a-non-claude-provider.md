# Spot-check reviewer seat runs async on a non-Claude provider, and its cost is measured

Rule 7 of #delegation-trial-record-graduation lets any provider fill the reviewer seat for the spot-check pass, and #3867 ratified that the pass runs asynchronously, off the landing path. Make the spot-check (#every-pr-gets-a-look-advisory-floor) juror default to a non-Claude provider (Codex is allowed for tool-free judging per rule 7; Gemini also possible) so the review costs ~no Claude usage; run it async after land, never in the merge path; record cost + wall time for the first 10 runs and report against the #3318 ~$0.43/PR full-lens baseline. #3313's '~$12.50 across 29 PRs' figure equals 29 x $0.43, i.e. the full-lens cost -- so the floor's own real cost is still unmeasured. Checked we:backlog/3593 (a syntactic scanner plus standing supervisor over subagent transcript compliance) as a possible vehicle for the async pass -- it targets mid-session agent behavioral compliance, not a post-land PR diff review, so it does not fit and is not linked here.

## Done when

1. **Executable** — the spot-check juror roster resolution (`we:scripts/lib/jury-core.mjs#resolveRoster`)
   defaults the `spot-check` care level to a non-Claude provider (Codex for tool-free judging; Gemini
   allowed) and a unit test pins that default.
2. **Executable** — the dispatch (`we:scripts/operations/review-dispatch.mjs`) runs the spot-check pass
   asynchronously after land, never inside the merge path, and a test shows a merge is never held on it.
3. **Observable** — cost (`costUsd`) and wall time are recorded for the first 10 real spot-check runs and
   reported against the #3318 ~$0.43/PR full-lens baseline, distinguishing the floor's own cost from the
   `~$12.50 across 29 PRs` figure (#3313), which is the full-lens cost (29 × $0.43), not the floor's.
