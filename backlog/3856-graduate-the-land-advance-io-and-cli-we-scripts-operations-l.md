# Graduate the land-advance IO and CLI (we:scripts/operations/land-advance-io.mjs) and its we:scripts/operations/run.mjs registration from lane/mechanical-dispatcher to main

Graduation slice 6 of 6 for the land-advance operation, the wiring slice. Ports we:scripts/operations/land-advance-io.mjs (224 lines) and we:scripts/operations/land-advance-cli.mjs (25), the LAND_ADVANCE_OP registration in we:scripts/operations/run.mjs, its read-only pin in we:scripts/operations/__tests__/http-adapter.test.mjs, and four tests. Lands after all five sibling slices and unblocks the #3443 reaper slice. Size 5, not 3: about 700 lines plus two shared files that differ on main. The notes below name every shared module to diff-merge rather than overwrite.

## Done when

1. **Executable** — `npx vitest run we:scripts/operations/__tests__/land-advance-io.test.mjs we:scripts/operations/__tests__/land-advance-io-real.test.mjs we:scripts/operations/__tests__/land-advance-cli.test.mjs we:scripts/operations/__tests__/land-advance-repair-io.test.mjs we:scripts/operations/__tests__/http-adapter.test.mjs` passes ON `main` after the port, the `land-advance` operation (run through `we:scripts/operations/run.mjs`, with `--json`) runs from a lane clone and prints a plan (plan by default; it must not execute anything without `--apply`), and `git diff origin/main...origin/lane/mechanical-dispatcher -- we:scripts/operations/land-advance-io.mjs we:scripts/operations/land-advance-cli.mjs we:scripts/operations/__tests__/land-advance-io.test.mjs we:scripts/operations/__tests__/land-advance-io-real.test.mjs we:scripts/operations/__tests__/land-advance-cli.test.mjs we:scripts/operations/__tests__/land-advance-repair-io.test.mjs` reports nothing. The diff of `we:scripts/operations/run.mjs` and `we:scripts/operations/__tests__/http-adapter.test.mjs` may show only hunks for branch-only operations (wip-agents, turn-digest, restart-runner and the like), never a land-advance hunk.
2. `npm run check:standards` reports 0 errors.
3. Landed as its own PR through the normal lane → `we:scripts/verify-lane.mjs` → `we:scripts/operations/run.mjs open-pr --mode=land` pipeline, never a direct push, and never before all five `blockedBy` slices above.

## Order and port notes

- Part of the six-slice land-advance graduation under #3443; this is the last slice. Order across the six: tools (2) → land-advance core (5) → session-verdicts (3); watchdog (1) and ci-heal (4) independent; this slice (6) after all five. It also unblocks the #3443 reaper slice, whose reaper imports `readFollowUps` from `we:scripts/operations/land-advance-io.mjs`. The branch's #3443 note lists a Fork A there (extract `readFollowUps` to a leaf first); this card does not touch that fork and ports `land-advance-io` whole, as the operator asked.
- **CORRECTION to the inventory:** `we:scripts/operations/__tests__/land-advance-repair-io.test.mjs` imports the io module and `we:scripts/operations/ci-heal-pr-dispatch.mjs`, so it belongs to this slice, not to the pure core slice. The branch's diffs of `we:scripts/operations/run.mjs` and the http-adapter test also carry other branch-only operations; port none of those.
- **Do not title the PR `#3443: …` or `WE #3443: …`.** The drain's resolve-on-land credited the epic as fully resolved from one partial-increment PR once before (#3473). Title each slice PR with its own card number.
- **What this slice does NOT deliver:** the item-pull half of #3720, the single-flight lease, the pause marker and the `Stop` hook. The prototype branch does not have them either (see the 2026-09-21 build-3720-queue-next result in the operations jobs folder), so #3720 stays open after this lands.
- Under the #3804 statute (`we:docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#poc-branch-mechanical-sync`) a graduation slice ports a file main has moved AS A DIFF and is exempt from the drift hold. Shared modules that exist on `main` with a different body and that this slice imports from: `we:scripts/operations/dispatch-lane-io.mjs`, `we:scripts/operations/dispatch-lane.mjs`, `we:scripts/operations/review-dispatch.mjs`, `we:scripts/conveyor/reconcile-fix-dispatch.mjs`, `we:scripts/conveyor/parked-pr-conflict-watch.mjs`, `we:scripts/operations/run-store.mjs`, `we:scripts/operations/effect-executor.mjs`. Every named import land-advance takes from them is already exported on `main`, checked name by name (`createFileRunStore` and `DISPATCH_EFFECT` included), so do NOT overwrite any of them with the branch copy. The files `main` has moved that this slice must edit are `we:scripts/operations/run.mjs` (add the two imports and the `LAND_ADVANCE_OP` registry line only) and `we:scripts/operations/__tests__/http-adapter.test.mjs` (add the `LAND_ADVANCE_OP` import and its read-only map entry only). If a test disagrees with a shared module's body, diff-merge only the hunk it needs and name it in the PR.
- The read-only pin only holds if `we:scripts/operations/land-advance.mjs` (the core slice) still reaches nothing that can act. All the effects live behind `we:scripts/operations/land-advance-io.mjs`. Run the http-adapter test before anything else.

## Step 0 re-plan (2026-09-22)

Added blockers #3865 and 3891: `we:scripts/operations/land-advance-io.mjs` imports `we:scripts/operations/land-advance-items-io.mjs` (#3865), which imports `we:scripts/lib/prototype-tracker-compact.mjs` (3891).
