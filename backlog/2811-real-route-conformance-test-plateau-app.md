# Real-route conformance test (plateau-app)

A conformance test (`plateau-app:tests/visual/real-route-fidelity.spec.ts`) that rides the plateau-app test run:
renders the assembled route via the harness [#2809] and cross-checks the frozen webcase required-set +
geometry [#2810] + singleton-chrome-by-role + theme. Orthogonal to the structural unit suite.

## Conveyor guardrail — self-proving, human-verify
**Do NOT auto-resolve on tests-green alone.** This is the assembled-route oracle; it must prove it catches the
real failure:

- Mounted on the CURRENT `/console-board`, the conformance test **must FAIL** (empty center, duplicate chrome,
  missing legend, wrong pool template). It goes green **only once the board is actually fixed** — so it doubles
  as the acceptance gate for the eventual console-board remediation.
- Must render the **real route in the host shell**, both themes, empty + overflow seeds. No `?demo=1`.
- `render-slice`: resolve gates on the rendered red→green proof, human-reviewed.
