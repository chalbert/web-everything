# Retire lane/daemon-poc now that daemons use live overlays

Ruling #3681 superseded the long-lived POC-branch approach for daemons (we:docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#resident-daemon-reload-lifecycle clause 5(g)). Wind down origin/lane/daemon-poc under its tracking epic xii6vye: its pass-daemon self-sync commit graduates through xdpemd4; its POC-mode commit (69b2ec0cc) is dropped as superseded by the overlay card xlqampw; its session-note commit needs no graduation. Then remove the lane/daemon-poc entry from we:scripts/lib/poc-branches.json and resolve xii6vye with a note naming what was dropped.
