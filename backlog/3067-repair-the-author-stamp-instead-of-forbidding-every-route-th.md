# Repair the author stamp instead of forbidding every route that strips it

`#3066` blocks the shell commands that wipe a PR's `authored-by-actor` stamp, and took **six review rounds
and six spellings** to get most of them. That is the wrong shape of fix: a deny-list over a CLI's argument
grammar can only ever enumerate. Notice a stamp is missing and put it back, and every route is covered at once
— including the ones no shell guard can reach. The reviewer's acceptance of `#3066` was explicitly
conditioned on this item existing.

## Why the deny-list cannot finish

Each round closed a real hole, verified against the live tool, and each time the author believed it was the
last:

| round | spelling |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | the long flag |
| 2 | the short flags |
| 3 | the quoted long flag |
| 4 | a shorthand with its value glued on |
| 5 | the REST field write, and a file-fed payload |
| 6 | the GraphQL endpoint, with the mutation in a file |

Round six also produced two spellings of the *same* endpoint that still slip: a leading slash, and the absolute
API URL. Both were fired at GitHub and reached the `updatePullRequest` resolver.

## The routes that remain open, named exhaustively

So the next reader does not have to rediscover them:

- **The GitHub web UI.** Edit a body in a browser and no shell guard exists to intercept it.
- **The GraphQL endpoint by non-canonical spelling** — a leading slash, or the full URL.
- **A forged identity.** Setting the session id directly defeats the comparison outright. Already ruled out of
  scope by `we:scripts/lib/review-independence.mjs` — this is the same determined-actor class.

The accident that actually happened, and every habitual spelling of it, IS covered. That is what the deny-list
is worth: it raises an accidental strip from free to "deliberately route around a named guard". It is not
coverage, and `#3066` should not be read as claiming otherwise.

## What repair looks like

The stamp is derivable after the fact — the PR's opening actor is knowable from the lane that produced it, and
the drain already reads PR bodies every pass. So:

1. **Detect.** A body with no `authored-by-actor` stamp is either an old PR or a stripped one. Today those are
   indistinguishable, which is exactly why the self-clear guard tolerates `unknown-author` and why
   `plateau-app#137`'s ancestor landed on its own author's clearance.
2. **Distinguish.** A PR opened after the stamp existed and now lacking one has been stripped. That is a
   checkable date comparison, not a judgement.
3. **Repair or refuse.** Restore the stamp from the recorded opener, or — if it cannot be recovered — mark the
   PR as *stamp-lost* so the clear refuses rather than tolerating it. The second half is the important one:
   the tolerance is only safe while "no stamp" reliably means "old".

Step 3's refusal is what makes this a fix rather than a nicety. Once a stripped body is distinguishable from an
old one, the guard can fail closed on the stripped case without stranding the old ones — which is the exact
trade `we:scripts/lib/review-independence.mjs` documents as impossible today.

## Done when

- [ ] A PR whose body lost its stamp is detected, and distinguished from one that never had it.
- [ ] The stamp is restored where the opener is recoverable.
- [ ] Where it is not, the clear REFUSES rather than reading as `unknown-author`.
- [ ] The web-UI route is covered, since it is the one no shell guard can reach — and is the test case.

## Progress

**Status:** the owed wiring is done and live. The item stays `active` — two halves remain, both deliberate.

**Branch:** `lane/3067-author-stamp`

**Done.** `we:scripts/lib/review-independence.mjs` grew `prCreatedAt`/`stampLostMarked` as OPT-IN inputs and its own header named the gap: *"wiring them into `we:scripts/review-set-label.mjs` / `we:scripts/lib/auto-land-seam.mjs` (so a live clear actually consults them) is left as this item's own owed follow-up"*. No live caller passed either, so **every clearance recorded `unknown-author`** whether the PR predated the regime or had a stamp stripped an hour ago — including all five recorded in this session.

`createdAt` now rides the existing `gh pr view` (one more `--json` field, no extra hop — the pattern `body` (#2844) and `state` (#2953) already use), and `we:scripts/review-set-label.mjs` passes both signals. A post-regime PR with no stamp now records **`stamp-lost`**; a pre-regime one still records `unknown-author`. Three end-to-end tests drive the real CLI against the recording fake `gh` and assert the durable comment, plus the opt-in case (no `createdAt` → byte-identical old behaviour). Mutant killed: dropping `prCreatedAt` from the call reddens the suite.

**Not done — `we:scripts/lib/auto-land-seam.mjs`, deliberately.** That seam is already STRICT fail-closed: `unknown-author` and `stamp-lost` both refuse, so wiring it changes only the reason string. It would cost threading two parameters through three signatures (`decideAutoLand`, `applyAutoLand`, and their caller) for no behaviour change. Recorded as a decision, not an oversight.

**Not done — making the clear REFUSE on `stamp-lost`.** This is the half that turns detection into enforcement, and it needs a call first. `we:scripts/review-set-label.mjs` refuses only `SELF_CLEAR`; adding `STAMP_LOST` would block **every PR opened outside `pr-land`** — which on a credential-less host is all of them, because `pr-land` needs `gh` and the MCP connector does not stamp. Those PRs are correctly `stamp-lost` (no authorship evidence exists, so tolerating them was never safe), but blocking them with no alternative stamping route strands the whole credential-less workflow. The refusal should land together with a route that stamps a PR opened without `pr-land`, not before it.

**Next.** Decide the pairing above; and check whether `we:scripts/pr-body-edit.mjs --repair` should run automatically from the drain (the card's second Done-when) rather than only by hand.

## The gap runs BOTH ways — demonstrated live, on two PRs, an hour apart

The case above is the permissive direction: no stamp, so a real self-clear cannot be proven and is not
refused. That is only half of it. The same missing stamp also produces the **accusatory** direction —
a genuinely independent clearance recorded as though it were not one.

Both happened on 2026-08-24, through the same code path, within an hour:

| PR | who cleared it | what the record says |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `plateau-app#145` | the PR's **own author** (`cleared-by-actor: f1f14019…`) | ⚠️ "Independence NOT established" — and **not refused**, because a missing stamp cannot prove `SELF_CLEAR` |
| `plateau-app#144` | a **different session** (`cleared-by-actor: ef04148a…`, the reviewing session, ≠ the author) | ⚠️ "Independence NOT established … This record does not show that a party other than the author cleared it" |

The second line is simply **false about what happened**. #144 *was* cleared by a party other than its
author — the request JSON carried that session id and the applier stamped it into the comment — yet the
comment asserts the opposite in the same sentence that carries the contradicting marker.

## Why this matters more than the permissive direction

A permissive miss is a hole someone could exploit. An accusatory miss is worse in ordinary operation,
because it is **routine and it trains the reader to ignore the warning**. Every PR opened outside
`we:scripts/pr-land.mjs` carries no stamp, so every such clearance — independent or not — renders the
identical ⚠️. Once the warning fires on the honest case as often as the dishonest one, it stops
distinguishing them, and #2844's record degrades from a signal into boilerplate. That is the failure
mode where the permissive hole actually gets exploited: not because the guard was absent, but because
its output had already been tuned out.

So the repair below is not only about refusing the right things. It is about the warning **meaning
something** when it does fire — which requires it to stay silent when independence genuinely held.

### Done when (addition)

3. **Executable** — a case where the clearer's session id differs from a *restored* author stamp asserts
   the comment carries **no** ⚠️ independence line. It must RED today, where the absent stamp forces the
   warning regardless of who actually cleared it.
