# Outside rollback removes an overlay that crash-loops or stalls a daemon

Ruling #3681, we:docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#resident-daemon-reload-lifecycle clause 5(d). New overlay code may crash at import, so the rollback cannot live inside it. The outside heartbeat check (xi58xoz) or the relaunch wrapper, on a crash loop or a stalled heartbeat right after an overlay change, removes that overlay from the clone's list and alerts. The next rebuild then runs without it. Re-adding the overlay is an explicit act.

## Done when

1. **Executable** — TODO: a command that fails before this item lands and passes after.
