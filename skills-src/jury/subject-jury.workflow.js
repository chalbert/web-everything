/**
 * subject-jury.workflow.js — the SUBJECT-AGNOSTIC jury harness (#2658, S6 / F1 front door of epic #2649).
 *
 * WHAT THIS IS. One Workflow harness that runs the jury on ANY of the three subjects — PR-diff review,
 * design-pixel review, decision-prose review — through that subject's adapter. It GENERALIZES the shape of the
 * PR-diff-only `we:scripts/workflows/review-parked-prs.mjs` (#2437): where that harness hard-codes the PR-diff
 * lens set, fetches a PR diff, and discovers parked PRs, THIS harness is told a `subject` + a `careLevel` + the
 * subject's `input`, asks the ENGINE (via the `resolve-roster.mjs` shim next to this file) to select the adapter
 * and resolve the roster (`resolveAdapterRoster` + `materializeRoster`), fans out one juror agent per rostered
 * seat under the adapter's own mandate, reduces the panel to a verdict through the shared review core, and RETURNS
 * an in-memory jury LEDGER — knowing nothing itself about diffs, pixels, or prose.
 *
 * NO JURY LOGIC LIVES HERE (the ratified F1 shape). Diversity-selection, the round cap, the care→rigor dial, which
 * lens is mandatory, how per-lens verdicts reduce to one — every such decision is a pure derivation in
 * `we:scripts/lib/jury-core.mjs` (+ the per-subject adapter), reached ONLY through the two shims this harness
 * shells: `resolve-roster.mjs` (roster + mandates) and `scripts/review-core-cli.mjs` (rigor + reduce). This body
 * orchestrates fan-out and I/O; it hand-rolls no judgment.
 *
 * HARNESS SANDBOX — structured EXACTLY like the proven reference `review-parked-prs.mjs` /
 * `we:skills-src/batch-backlog-items/parallel-execute.workflow.js`: a PURE literal `export const meta`, then a
 * TOP-LEVEL body that uses the injected runtime primitives (`agent()`, `parallel()`, `pipeline()`, `phase()`,
 * `log()`, and the `args` global) and ends with a top-level `return`. The harness strips `export const meta` and
 * runs the rest as a wrapped body, so this file is NOT an importable ES module (`node --check` fails on the
 * top-level `return`, exactly as it does on the reference). Consequences:
 *   • NO `import` — the body cannot pull in `jury-core.mjs` / an adapter directly.
 *   • NO `child_process` / filesystem / `Date.now()` / `Math.random()` in the body — it has no Node API.
 *   • EVERYTHING that shells a command or reads a file happens INSIDE an `agent(prompt, {schema})` call — the
 *     subagent runs `node skills-src/jury/resolve-roster.mjs` / `node scripts/review-core-cli.mjs …` and returns
 *     structured data. Small PURE orchestration helpers are inlined as top-level `function` declarations.
 *
 * THE LEDGER BOUNDARY (F4 — the jury made observable, #2641). This harness JUDGES and RETURNS a ledger; it applies
 * no label, posts no comment, merges nothing — the caller decides what a verdict does (the same "decisions stay in
 * the loop" boundary review-parked-prs holds). The ledger it returns is IN-MEMORY only: the append-only #2654
 * events shaped as plain objects (the `roster-picked` seed comes back schema-valid from the shim; the harness
 * appends `juror-running` / `finding` / `verdict` events as it fans out). The DURABLE on-disk logbook + the fold
 * that replays it is #2641, NOT this slice — this returns the live ledger for the caller / the #2642 console to
 * render now.
 *
 * SAFETY — a juror that did not run NEVER reads as accept. If a MANDATORY lens's whole jury fails to run, the panel
 * degrades to `needs-human` (a human disposition), never a silent accept on missing signal — the same fail-closed
 * posture review-parked-prs takes for a dead mandatory reviewer.
 *
 * THE MANDATORY POST-JURY RED-TEAM (#2707). A jury `accept` is a PROPOSAL, never an auto-land: before the loop
 * ratifies a positive verdict, ONE adversarial red-team agent actively tries to BREAK it (the OPPOSITE stance to a
 * neutral juror — it assumes the accept is wrong and hunts the reason it should not ship). Its result folds through
 * the SAME shared review core: a red-team that ran CLEAN ratifies (land), one that broke the accept bounces
 * (`changes` — its findings feed the round loop), and one that did NOT run degrades to needs-human. This is
 * FAIL-CLOSED — an unrun red-team NEVER ratifies — closing the fabricated-ratings gap the #2707 session hit (a
 * "foreman" synthesizing a positive verdict over a jury that produced no real signal). The two engine rules it
 * enacts — `redTeamRequired(verdict)` (owed exactly on `accept`) and `foldRedTeamVerdict({ran, findings})` — live
 * in jury-core, never here (F1).
 *
 * THE SELF-DRIVING CONVERGENCE LOOP (#2685). The editor↔reviewer round loop IS driven here now (it was deferred in
 * the #2658 MVP): panel → reduce → on a `changes` verdict UNDER the round cap, one bounded editor agent FOLDS the
 * round's findings into a revised subject, then the panel re-runs on the revision; repeat. The continue/escalate
 * call is NOT the harness's judgment — every round it reads `deriveNegotiationOutcome({verdict, round, roundCap})`
 * off the reduce CLI's `.outcome` (single-sourced in jury-core, never re-decided per caller — rule #51). The loop
 * escalates MECHANICALLY on `needs-human` (any round) or `changes` at the round cap, emitting an escalation packet
 * (round history + surviving findings) — the ONE place a human enters. MECHANICAL = round accounting, verdict
 * routing, the continue/escalate decision, the escalation packet; AI (irreducible) = the jurors' verdicts and the
 * fold. The round CAP is the care band's negotiation-pass dial (`plan.rounds`, engine-capped at NEGOTIATION_ROUND_CAP).
 *
 * DEFERRED (out of this slice). The durable jury logbook (#2641), the roster reconcile-at-PR-open (#2635), and the
 * disposition judge over the ledger (#2652) are their own slices — this returns the IN-MEMORY ledger + escalation
 * packet. The design-pixels `visual` lens's `screenshot-vs-target` grounding is DEFERRED in its adapter (#2657) — a
 * juror on that lens judges by eye and says so. The optional early-stuck (recurring-finding) signal noted in #2685
 * is not built; the round cap alone satisfies "escalate only if stuck (= didn't converge in N rounds)".
 *
 * LIVE VALIDATION awaits a real subject run — a harness workflow is not unit-testable (it needs live agents + the
 * runtime primitives). The `resolve-roster.mjs` shim it shells is pure glue over engine functions that ARE
 * unit-tested (`we:scripts/lib/__tests__/jury-core.test.mjs` + the per-adapter suites); the shim itself is
 * smoke-validated across the three subjects (its only job is arg-parse → engine call → JSON print).
