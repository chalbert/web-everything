# Conveyor — main-session judgment layer over a headless runner (#2703, epic #2677/#2612)

The interim swimlane-progression loop. It has **two planes** since #2703 retired the main-session serial tick
loop:

- **The mechanical plane — a singleton-locked HEADLESS RUNNER** (`skills-src/conveyor/runner.mjs`, #2702). It
  drives the whole per-tick cycle — read state → plan the dispatch → step every guard/TTL/re-dispatch/watcher-arm
  /idle-stop decision through the tick core → run the deterministic cleanup passes — with **no model context per
  tick**. It **decides dispatch and watch**; it **never merges** and **never self-clears a human review**. It
  does not itself spawn LLM agents — it **surfaces** its already-filtered dispatch/watch decisions.
- **The judgment plane — THIS main session.** It **starts and supervises** the runner, then handles only the
  genuine judgment the runner can't: the readiness/operator conversation, clearing items for build, reviewing an
  escalation (`/review`), ratifying a prepared decision, surfacing a cleared epic for `/slice`, and — as the
  **interim bridge** until the headless agent-runner backend lands (below) — spawning, **on demand**, the LLM
  agents the runner surfaced. The chat stays a normal readiness conversation; the mechanical tick runs off in the
  runner.

This is the ratified **mechanics-not-per-lane-agent** split
([we:docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#conveyor-orchestration-mechanics-not-per-lane-agent](../../docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#conveyor-orchestration-mechanics-not-per-lane-agent),
#2701): driving one lane through dispatch → watch → release → tick is **pure deterministic mechanics stepped by a
headless runner**, not a per-lane LLM agent that re-derives the loop each tick. It runs now because the product
conveyor (the #2527 console board) is not built yet and one-story-at-a-time delivery is too slow.

> **The main session no longer runs the tick (#2703).** Before #2703 this main session *was* the tick loop — it

> back into the runner's guards (`runner.mjs` folds no such signal today). Two consequences to state plainly:
>   - **Read the surface as structured JSON.** Launch the runner with `--json` (§2) so each tick prints the
>     already-filtered `{ dispatch: { builds, prepareScope, … }, armWatchers, notes, statusLine }` — the bare
>     runner prints only human counts, not the `{num, lane}` entries the judgment layer spawns from. The runner's
>     surface is the ONLY correct source of the guard-filtered launch list: an on-demand `dispatch-plan` /
>     `conveyor-state` read is UNFILTERED (it hasn't been through the in-flight guards, whose bookkeeping lives in
>     the runner's process, §5), and this session must not re-shell `tick-core` on a timer (that is the retired
>     serial loop).
>   - **The bridge is on-demand, not a chat loop.** A backgrounded runner notifies this session on its *exit*,
>     not per tick, so there is **no** automatic per-tick wake into the chat — reintroducing one would BE the
>     retired serial loop. Until the headless backend lands, the judgment layer reads the runner's latest surfaced
>     decisions and spawns the surfaced agents when it engages (an operator turn, a review, a completed agent's
>     return). This is **not** re-running the loop: the runner did all the planning, guard math, TTLs,
>     re-dispatch gating, and cleanup passes; the main session only *executes* the already-decided spawns and does
>     the genuine judgment. When the headless backend lands, agent-spawning (and the return-fold) moves into the
>     runner and this bridge retires.

The runner and the scripts it (and the on-demand judgment surfaces) shell — do not reimplement any of them:

| Script | What it decides (deterministically) |
|---|---|
| `node skills-src/conveyor/runner.mjs` | **The singleton-locked HEADLESS RUNNER (#2702)** — the mechanical plane. The main session STARTS this (background); it then drives the whole per-tick cycle with **no model context**: it shells `tick-core` (bookkeeping in on STDIN, `{ decisions, nextState }` out), threads `nextState` forward UNCHANGED, runs the two deterministic passes (§4b/§4c), emits the status line, and **surfaces** the dispatch/watch decisions for the judgment layer to execute. Its singleton right is held by `runner-lock.mjs` (a machine-global TTL lease — a second launch that finds a LIVE runner stands down). It **never merges** and **never self-clears a human review**. |
| `node scripts/readiness/conveyor-state.mjs --json` | **The whole tick picture in one read** — `{ queue, clearedNotReady, unshaped, needsSlice, decisions, lanes, freeSlots, prs, daemon, idle, health, infraBlocked }`. The runner's every tick STARTS here (via `tick-core`); the judgment layer reads it on demand (status board, `/review` context). |
| `node scripts/conveyor/infra-blocked.mjs retry` | **The infra-blocked recovery pass (#2659)** — one idempotent resume pass: for each item whose lane ref was PUSHED but whose PR-open failed on an outside dependency (a GitHub outage), it correlates GitHub status, resume-opens the PR once infra recovers (via `pr-land` — never a local merge), backs off on failure, and surfaces at the attempt cap. |
| `node scripts/readiness/dispatch-plan.mjs --json` | **The dispatcher** — `{ launch: [{num, lane}], held: [{num, reason}] }`. Which cleared items launch into which free lanes, and why the rest hold. |
| `node scripts/conveyor/tick-core.mjs` (stdin ⇽ bookkeeping) <!-- @operation-home-ok: #3096 (born-as #xaibmeu) — the skill needs the WHOLE tick here, not just the dispatch slice `dispatch-lane` declares over; routing the spawnBuilds and spawnPrepareScope halves through the operation is its own item. Repointed 2026-08-26: this marker named #xbbscm5 (#3239), which is now resolved as a duplicate of #3096 along with #3147 — #3096 is the surviving card and carries both halves. --> | **The MECHANIZED tick core (#2699)** — the whole per-tick state machine in one call: it shells `conveyor-state` + `dispatch-plan` + the free-lane picker, takes your in-session guard/watcher bookkeeping on STDIN, and returns `{ decisions, nextState }`. `decisions` = `{ spawnBuilds, spawnPrepareScope, spawnPrepareDecision, spawnFixes, spawnCiHeals, armWatchers, retireGuards, idleStop, statusLine, notes }`; `nextState` = the next tick's bookkeeping. The FOUR guards (build, prepare, fix, CI-heal), their retirement (claim/return/TTL/PR-terminal/CI-recovery), the union re-dispatch gate, watcher arming, and idle-stop are all DECIDED here — you EXECUTE the decisions and carry `nextState` forward, you never re-derive a guard rule in prose. |
| `node scripts/conveyor/pr-watch.mjs <pr>` | **The merge watcher** — one background process per in-flight PR, now the OPTIONAL merge-time fast-path for lease release (§4); the runner is self-clocked, so this is no longer the loop's wake. Its exit CODE is the outcome (merged 0 · error 1 · parked 2 · timeout 3 · closed 4). |

> **Auto-prepare for unscoped items (#2613, corrected design — Nicolas, 2026-07-22).** Predicted `scope:` is
> authored UPSTREAM at readiness; the dispatcher only READS it — it never probes for scope at dispatch and

> Instead, the conveyor **auto-prepares** it: each tick, for every `unshaped-no-scope` held item (from the plan /

> — being codified in a sibling statute PR).

> **A cleared epic is a slice trigger, not a dead end (#2645).** An **epic** is a CONTAINER — its work lives in
> child stories/tasks, so it is **never directly buildable**. Before this rule a cleared epic fell into a silent
> hole: the dispatcher never launched it (an epic isn't agent-ready) and nothing routed it to slicing either. Now

> lifecycle is **prepare** (research + author its forks to "ready to ratify", the `/prepare` skill's autonomous
> half) then **present** (surface the prepared forks for a human to ratify). A decision carries no `scope:`, so —
> exactly like an epic — a cleared `kind:decision` is held **`needs-decision`** ("decision — prepare its forks,
> then present for ratify"), checked BEFORE the scope gate so it is **not** mislabeled `unshaped-no-scope` and
> aimed at a scope-prediction agent (which authors a build touch-set — meaningless for a decision). Each tick
> surfaces every cleared decision in `state.decisions` (each entry carries `prepared` + `preparedDate`); handle
> them per §3e — route by `prepared`: **UNPREPARED → spawn a prepare-decision agent** (autonomous research +
> fork authoring, lands a `preparedDate`); **PREPARED → present its forks** (a chat artefact + the #2565 ruling
> surface) for the human to ratify. Ratifying is human judgment — the conveyor prepares and presents, it never
> auto-ratifies. So a cleared decision always ends up either prepared-and-presented or explicitly awaiting

The agent templates it instantiates: [`delivery-agent-brief.md`](delivery-agent-brief.md) (build a scoped
item, #2608), [`prepare-scope-agent-brief.md`](prepare-scope-agent-brief.md) (author an unscoped item's
`scope:`, #2613), [`prepare-decision-agent-brief.md`](prepare-decision-agent-brief.md) (prepare an unprepared
decision's forks to "ready to ratify", #2647), [`fix-agent-brief.md`](fix-agent-brief.md) (repair a
`review:changes` bounce in its own lane and re-arm review, #2630), and
[`fix-agent-ci-brief.md`](fix-agent-ci-brief.md) (rebase + repair a green-at-open PR gone red/BEHIND — CI only,
never the review label, #2666).

## 1. Start / configure (a short conversation, then the loop)

Confirm three settings with the operator, then start ticking. Each has a default — a bare `/conveyor N` sets
the pool size to `N` and takes the defaults for the rest.

- **Pool size** — the max parallel lanes (the launch budget). Ensure the pool is provisioned to it:
  `node scripts/lane-pool.mjs provision --count=<N> --acquirable`. `freeSlots` in the state read is how many
  of those are currently free.
- **Per-program conflict policy** — what to do when a newly-queued item overlaps a running lane's scope:
  **wait** (default — hold it behind the lane, the dispatch plan already does this), **ask** (surface it and
  let the operator decide), or **force** (launch anyway — rarely wanted; two lanes on one path is a merge
  hazard). This only changes how you present a `held: "overlaps lane-N"` entry (§3); it never changes the plan.
- **Idle-stop window** — how long the queue stays empty with no operator feedback before the conveyor stops
  itself (default **15 min**).

State plainly to the operator, once, at start:

> **The chat stays conversational.** The conveyor runs in the background; ticks arrive on a timer and never
> block the chat. You steer it by talking here and by queuing work — to clear an item for the conveyor to
> pull, run:
> ```bash
> node scripts/conveyor/queue.mjs add <NNN>      # clear-for-build: the conveyor may now pull it
> node scripts/conveyor/queue.mjs remove <NNN>   # un-clear it (before it launches)
> node scripts/conveyor/queue.mjs list           # show what you've cleared this session
> ```
> The conveyor pulls **only** cleared items, in the build queue's ranked order. Re-prioritising the backlog
> never arms a build — clearing does. Type the id with or without a leading `#` (`add 2613` ≡ `add '#2613'`).
>
> **Clearing a not-yet-ready item is allowed but flagged.** If you clear an id that is not currently a ready
> build-queue row (blocked / resolved / typo), `add` still records it — a temporarily-blocked item auto-arms
> when its blocker lands — but it **warns** rather than silently doing nothing, and the tick's
> `state.clearedNotReady` (and a `held: 'cleared-but-not-ready'` in the dispatch plan) shows it so you always
> see "you cleared #X but it isn't ready". **JIT-numbering drift:** clear the id the tooling currently shows —
> a sidecar entry cleared as a `xHASH` won't match once the item lands as `#NNN` (and vice-versa); if a cleared
> id stops matching, `remove` it and re-`add` the current id.
>
> **The conveyor queue is SESSION-LOCAL** (#2613). `queue.mjs add/remove` writes a gitignored sidecar
> (`.conveyor/queue.json`) — it is NOT a card mutation (it never touches backlog frontmatter or
> `writeBacklogMd`), so it is **not** policed by the no-override lane guard and runs fine from THIS main

Then start the headless runner (§2).

## 2. Start the runner — it IS the tick loop now (#2702/#2703)

**The main session does NOT run the tick.** It launches the singleton-locked headless runner as a background
process, and from then on the runner drives every beat with no model context. Start it once:

```bash
node skills-src/conveyor/runner.mjs --json   # run_in_background: true — the mechanical plane's whole lifetime
```

`--json` makes each tick print its already-filtered surface as one JSON line
(`{ tick, statusLine, notes, dispatch: { builds, prepareScope, prepareDecision, fixes, ciHeals }, armWatchers }`)
— the structured record the judgment-layer bridge spawns from (§3). Without it the runner prints human count
lines only, with no `{num, lane}` entries to act on.

- **Singleton-locked — a second launch is safe and stands down.** `runner.mjs` acquires the machine-global
  runner lease (`runner-lock.mjs`) at startup; if a LIVE runner already holds it, the new launch NO-OPs (exit 0,
  "another conveyor runner holds the singleton lease; standing down"). So starting the conveyor when one is
  already running never double-drives — the lock is the cross-process guard the in-session dispatch guard can't
  see. The runner heartbeats the lease every tick and releases it at exit; a crashed runner's stale lease is
  reclaimable via the TTL, so a fresh `/conveyor` restarts cleanly.
- **The runner is self-clocked (no chained `sleep` from this session).** It sleeps ~120 s between ticks
  internally (just under the 5-min prompt-cache window — a legacy of the chained-sleep heartbeat this retired).
  It re-reads fresh state every tick, so it does **not** depend on a `pr-watch` exit or a `ScheduleWakeup` to
  advance. The old main-session chained-`sleep` heartbeat is **gone** (#2703).
- **The runner spends NO model context.** Every guard, TTL, re-dispatch gate, watcher-arm, and idle-stop is the
  tick core's; the runner threads the core's `nextState` forward unchanged and surfaces the decisions.

**What the runner does each tick — for reference (you do NOT run these; the runner does).** The steps below
DOCUMENT the mechanical tick the runner owns, so the semantics stay legible and the judgment layer knows what a
surfaced decision means. They are **not** a checklist for this session to execute on a timer.

1. **Read the whole picture (one call):** `node scripts/readiness/conveyor-state.mjs --json`
   → `{ queue, clearedNotReady, unshaped, needsSlice, decisions, lanes, freeSlots, prs, daemon, idle, health, infraBlocked }`.

2. **Plan the dispatch (one call):** `node scripts/readiness/dispatch-plan.mjs --json`
   → `{ launch: [{num, lane}], held: [{num, reason}] }`. THE dispatcher — the queue × active scope-leases ×
   free lanes decision. (It shells the same build-queue, scope-lease, and pool pickers under the hood, so its
   inputs match the state read above.)

2b. **Plan the whole tick (one call) — the MECHANIZED core decides every guard (#2699).** The runner shells
   `tick-core.mjs`, piping the previous tick's `nextState` (its process-ephemeral **bookkeeping** — `{ tick,
   buildGuards, prepareGuards, fixGuards, fixAttempts, ciHealGuards, ciHealAttempts, watched, launchedNums }`,
   plus `signals`, `{}` on the first tick) in on STDIN. `tick-core` re-shells the state read + dispatch plan +
   free-lane picker under the hood and returns `{ decisions: { spawnBuilds, spawnPrepareScope,
   spawnPrepareDecision, spawnFixes, spawnCiHeals, armWatchers, retireGuards, idleStop, statusLine, notes },
   nextState }`. The runner surfaces `decisions` and carries `nextState` into the next tick's STDIN **unchanged**
   — it never re-derives a guard, a TTL, a re-dispatch gate, or the idle clock. The guard sections further down
   DOCUMENT what the core encodes (so the semantics stay legible); they are not a second place to compute them.

   > **The bookkeeping is PROCESS-EPHEMERAL — it lives in the RUNNER's process, threaded through STDIN, never a
   > repo file (SKILL §5, memory rule 105).** It is which background jobs the runner surfaced, not item state; the
   > board stays the single truth. `tick-core` reads it in and returns the updated `nextState`, which the runner
   > threads into the next tick — so the whole guard/watcher ledger lives in the runner's memory, not this
   > session's, and no parallel on-disk store is ever created. (Before #2703 this ledger lived in the main
   > session's context; retiring the serial loop moved it into the runner.)

**What the JUDGMENT LAYER does with the surface.** The runner emits its per-tick `--json` surface (the status
line + the already-filtered `dispatch` / `armWatchers` decisions + the `notes`). Until the headless agent-runner
backend lands (intro bridge callout), the main session reads that surface and executes it **on demand** —
spawning each surfaced agent and handling each surfaced escalation per §3 below — when it engages, NOT on a
per-tick chat loop (there is no automatic per-tick wake; reintroducing one would be the retired serial loop). It
performs **no** guard math, TTL, or planning of its own — the runner already did all of it; the judgment layer
only spawns and judges.

3. **Spawn ONE background delivery agent per surfaced `decisions.spawnBuilds` entry.** The core has ALREADY filtered
   `plan.launch` through the *In-flight dispatch guard* (dropping any launch whose `num` **or** assigned `lane`
   is held by a still-pending spawned agent) and recorded the new guard entries in `nextState.buildGuards` — so
   you just spawn each `{num, lane}` it returns, no guard math of your own:
   - Resolve the item's spec path by **globbing `backlog/<num>-*.md`** (the plan returns only `{num, lane}`, not
     the slug), then read that file and its `scope:` frontmatter.
   - Instantiate [`delivery-agent-brief.md`](delivery-agent-brief.md) by substituting its placeholders:
     `{{ITEM_NUM}}`=`num`, `{{ITEM_SPEC_PATH}}`=the globbed `backlog/<num>-<slug>.md`, `{{LANE}}`=`lane`,
     `{{SESSION_SLUG}}`=`conveyor-<num>`, `{{SCOPE}}`=the item's `scope:` entries, repo-qualified and
     comma-joined (e.g. `we:scripts/conveyor,we:skills-src/conveyor`). Those five `{{DOUBLE_BRACE}}` tokens are
     the whole fill — the brief already names the real learnings drop-box command (`learnings-drop.mjs`) and
     every other step verbatim; do not rewrite its prose.
   - Spawn it as **one background `Agent`** with the filled brief as the prompt (default `run_in_background`).
     One agent = one item = one lane = one PR. The agent acquires its lane, claims the item, builds it, gets the
     gate green, then **runs an adversarial code-review subagent on its own diff and addresses the findings to
     convergence BEFORE opening the PR** (a green gate is not a review — #deterministic-core-thin-judgment: the
     gate is the deterministic core, the review is the judgment). Only then does it open the PR —
     `ready-to-merge` for a clean, reviewed, non-statute change, or parked `review:human` **only for good
     reason** (below) — and **exits without merging**.
   - **The guard entry is already recorded** — `tick-core` put `{ num, lane, spawnedTick }` for each spawn in
     `nextState.buildGuards` (see the guard below for what it encodes). You do not maintain it by hand.

3b. **Auto-prepare every unscoped held item — spawn ONE background prepare-scope agent per
   `decisions.spawnPrepareScope` entry.** The dispatcher NEVER launches an unscoped item to build; it holds it
   `unshaped-no-scope` and surfaces it in `state.unshaped`. `tick-core` has ALREADY applied the *prepare in-flight
   test* — the **union** re-dispatch gate: it skips any `num` for which EITHER a live prepare-guard entry exists
   OR `state.prs` has an **OPEN PR for that `num`** (while the item is still `unshaped-no-scope` it has **no** build
   PR, so any open PR for its `num` can only be its in-flight prepare — the backstop if the guard entry were lost)
   — and it has already **picked each prepare's lane** from the free lanes MINUS this tick's builds MINUS every
   guard-held lane (the same lane exclusion the build guard uses), recording the `{ num, kind:'prepare', lane }`
   entry in `nextState.prepareGuards`. So you just spawn each `{num, lane}` the core returns. Deciding to prepare
   vs to build is entirely the dispatch plan's classification the core reads (scoped → `spawnBuilds`; unscoped →
   `spawnPrepareScope`). Each prepare is **parallel-safe** with every build and every other prepare — its
   `--scope` is a single, distinct backlog file (`we:backlog/<num>-<slug>.md`), disjoint by construction. For each
   `{num, lane}` in `decisions.spawnPrepareScope`:
   - Resolve the item's spec path by **globbing `backlog/<num>-*.md`** (this is the ONLY file the prepare edits).
   - Instantiate [`prepare-scope-agent-brief.md`](prepare-scope-agent-brief.md) by substituting its four
     placeholders: `{{ITEM_NUM}}`=`num`, `{{ITEM_SPEC_PATH}}`=the globbed `backlog/<num>-<slug>.md`, `{{LANE}}`=the
     picked lane, `{{SESSION_SLUG}}`=`prepare-<num>`. Those four `{{DOUBLE_BRACE}}` tokens are the whole fill — do
     not rewrite the brief's prose.
   - Spawn it as **one background `Agent`** with the filled brief as the prompt. It acquires its lane, predicts the
     item's touch-set, writes `scope:` into the one backlog file, gets the gate green, then **runs an adversarial
     review subagent on its own scope prediction and addresses the findings to convergence BEFORE opening the
     PR** (the operator invariant #2629: no PR reaches a human review gate without a prior AI convergence pass —
     a scope PR can still be human-routed when statute-touching or sampled). Only then does it open a one-file
     `ready-to-merge` PR (auto-lands — no review escalation unless the item is statute-touching), then **exits
     without merging**. When that PR lands the item is scoped and dispatches to **build** on a later tick.
   - **The prepare-guard entry is already recorded** — `tick-core` put `{ num, kind: 'prepare', lane, spawnedTick,
     sawPr:false }` in `nextState.prepareGuards`, keyed by `num` (the contended resource is the item's scope
     authorship; the lane is carried only for this tick's exclusion). Its retirement is DIFFERENT from a build
     guard's and the core enforces it — see the prepare guard below. **Critically: a prepare Agent RETURNING does
     NOT retire its guard** (it returns at PR-open, mid-flight — several ticks before the PR merges); the core has
     no return path for a prepare guard at all.

4. **The watch is the runner's — it surfaces `decisions.armWatchers`, scoped to items THIS conveyor launched.**
   `state.prs` is built from `gh pr list` **repo-wide**, so it also carries PRs from other sessions / humans.
   `tick-core` has ALREADY filtered it to OPEN PRs whose `num` this conveyor dispatched this session
   (`nextState.launchedNums` — builds AND prepares), dropped the already-watched ones, and pruned the watched set
   to the currently-open conveyor PRs (`nextState.watched`). Each `decisions.armWatchers` entry is a
   `{ pr, releaseSession }` pair — the core already derived the `--release-session` slug (`conveyor-<num>` for a
   build PR, `prepare-<num>` / `prepare-decision-<num>` for a prepare PR). **The runner is self-clocked — it does
   NOT depend on a `pr-watch` exit to advance** (it re-reads fresh `state.prs` every tick and surfaces terminal
   PRs itself, §3). So a `pr-watch` process is now only the FAST-path for merge-time lease release, not the loop's
   wake; the judgment-layer bridge may spawn one per surfaced entry, but the runner's own per-tick **lease-reaper
   (§4c)** is the guaranteed backstop:
   ```bash
   node scripts/conveyor/pr-watch.mjs <pr> --release-session=<releaseSession>   # optional fast-path
   ```
   - **`--release-session` wires in the ghost-lease auto-release (#2667/#2700).** On a **merge** exit (and ONLY on
     merge — a park / close / timeout leaves the still-in-use lane held), pr-watch runs
     `lane-pool release --all-pools --session=<slug>`, which hands that item's lane lease back in EVERY pool it
     acquired AND resets the freed clone to origin/main. It is best-effort: a release hiccup never changes the
     merge outcome, because the runner's per-tick **lease-reaper (§4c)** is the catch-all backstop for anything it
     misses (a fix lease, a dead agent that never opened a PR, a merge that landed while nothing was watching).
   - **Prepare-scope PRs are watched the same way** (their `num` was dispatched this session too). When a prepare
     PR **merges**, the item now carries committed `scope:`, so the very next tick's `dispatch-plan` sees it as
     scoped and the runner surfaces it to **BUILD** — the auto-prepare → build handoff. The prepare PR reaching a
     terminal state (merged / closed / failed) is a prepare-guard RETIREMENT trigger (see the prepare guard
     below) — but the prepare **Agent returning is NOT**, because it returns at PR-open, several ticks before the
     PR lands.

4b. **The runner runs the infra-blocked recovery pass each tick — auto-retry/resume any pushed-but-unopened work
   (#2659).** A delivery or prepare agent that BUILT successfully and PUSHED its `lane/*` ref, but whose PR-open
   then failed on an OUTSIDE dependency (a GitHub partial outage, a network fault), returns `blocked-on-infra` —
   its built work is pushed and RECORDED, but no PR exists yet to watch. The runner runs ONE recovery pass per
   tick (`node scripts/conveyor/infra-blocked.mjs retry`) as a best-effort mechanical pass — the tick is the loop
   clock, so the pass does ONE round, no internal busy-loop. For each recorded item it correlates GitHub status (a
   real outage vs a one-off), and, once the backoff has elapsed, **resume-opens the PR from the recorded ref via
   `pr-land` — never a local merge** (the drain stays the sole writer to `main`, memory rule 104). On failure it
   backs off (exponential, capped); at the attempt cap it stops auto-retrying and **surfaces** the item for the
   operator. `state.infraBlocked` (and the ⊘ marker / collapsed **OUTAGE** banner on the status board) shows what
   is blocked and why — see §3f. `pr-land` records the block automatically at the failed open, so a
   conveyor-launched agent's `blocked-on-infra` return needs no extra bookkeeping.

4c. **The runner runs the lease-reaper each tick — the periodic ghost-lease backstop (#2667/#2700).** Merge-time
   auto-release (§4's `--release-session`) is the FAST path: it frees an item's lane the instant its PR merges.
   But it can't catch everything — a delivery agent that **died mid-build** (an API death) never opened a PR to
   merge, a **fix** lease (`fix-<num>`) rides a different session than the one the watcher releases, and a merge
   that landed while nothing was watching released nothing. So the runner runs ONE reaper pass per tick as the
   catch-all (`node scripts/conveyor/lease-reaper.mjs`; a gh-unavailable run degrades to the TTL-stale axis). It
   walks **every** lane pool and reclaims an orphan lease on any of its axes — the item's PR reached a terminal
   state (merged / closed, matched by head ref `lane/<num>-*`), or the lease outlived its TTL (the zero-IO
   dead-agent backstop) — delegating each reclamation to `lane-pool release --force` (so the reserved-memory-lane
   protection lives in ONE place; the reaper never rm's a marker itself). Like the §4b pass, the tick is the loop
   clock — one round per tick, no internal busy-loop. It is best-effort: a stuck lane is logged and skipped, and
   its exit never gates the tick. A freed lane is picked up by the very next tick's `dispatch-plan`.

5. **The runner emits `decisions.statusLine` and arms its OWN next tick.** The core builds the terse one-line
   status from the tick read + the live bookkeeping (counts of building / preparing / fixing / healing / queued /
   parked + the health verdict, with `· N infra-blocked` and a `⚠ lane-N` warn suffix appended when they apply)
   and gathers the per-tick surfaces in `decisions.notes` (a TTL re-dispatch warning, a `needs-slice` epic §3d, a
   prepared `decision-ready` §3e). The runner emits that line + notes each tick; if `decisions.idleStop` is true it
   STOPS itself (§6) instead of sleeping. **The main session does NOT arm a `sleep` heartbeat** — the runner is
   self-clocked (§2). The judgment layer surfaces the runner's status line / notes to the operator only when they
   carry something the operator must act on (a park to `/review`, an epic to `/slice`, a capped infra-block). Per
   the operator's progress-tracking preference the checklist is the channel and prose stays quiet — the runner's
   one line per tick reads, e.g.:
   > `conveyor · N building · N preparing · N fixing · N healing · N queued · N parked · health ok` — add
   > `· N infra-blocked` when `state.infraBlocked` is non-empty (pushed-but-unopened work the §4b pass is
   > auto-retrying; flag a capped/exhausted one for the operator) — where **`N preparing`**
   > is the count of prepare-scope agents in flight (auto-preparing unscoped items' scope), **`N fixing`** is
   > the count of fix agents in flight (repairing `review:changes` bounces, §3c), and **`N healing`** is the count
   > of CI-heal agents in flight (rebasing + repairing green-at-open PRs gone red/BEHIND, §3c-ci). Add `⚠` + the flagged lanes
   > when `state.health.verdict === 'warn'`; add `⚠ N auto-preparing scope: #A #B` when `state.unshaped` is
   > non-empty, so the operator sees those cleared items are being scoped now (a prepare agent per item) and will
   > build once their scope lands — see the auto-prepare callout above.
   The runner then sleeps ~120 s (just under the 5-min prompt-cache window) and steps the next tick. That
   self-clocked sleep REPLACES the retired main-session chained-`sleep` heartbeat (#2703) — the main session arms
   nothing.

**In-flight dispatch guard (the one bit of ephemeral bookkeeping — held in the runner's process, #2703).**
Between a delivery agent being surfaced/spawned and that agent acquiring its lane + claiming the item, the item
is still in the queue and its lane still reads free — so a naive next tick could double-dispatch it. The core
keeps a list of guard entries (threaded through the runner's `nextState`, one per spawned agent):
`{ num, lane, spawnedTick }`. On each tick it **filters `plan.launch`** (`filterLaunches`) to drop any
entry whose `num` **OR** whose assigned `lane` matches a live guard entry — the contended resource is the LANE,
not just the item, so both must be excluded (else tick N launches `{num:100, lane:4}`, 100 is slow to acquire,
and tick N+1 re-assigns lane 4 to a different top-of-queue `num` while agent A is still starting — two agents
targeting lane 4).

**The prepare guard is DIFFERENT bookkeeping — do not copy the build guard's retirement.** A prepare-scope agent
(§3b) gets a `{ num, kind: 'prepare', spawnedTick }` entry, keyed by `num` (the contended resource is the item's
scope authorship, not the incidental lane). But a prepare is fundamentally unlike a build: **a build claims and
leaves the queue within a tick or two; a prepare NEVER claims and leaves the queue only at MERGE** — its item
stays `unshaped-no-scope` / in `state.unshaped` for every tick from spawn until its scope PR lands (CI + drain
latency, several ticks). And its Agent returns at **PR-open**, well before merge. So the build guard's "retire on
Agent-return" rule is a **double-dispatch bug** for a prepare (it would clear the guard while the item is still
unscoped, and step 3b would spawn a second, third, … prepare each tick until merge — competing same-file PRs on
burned lanes). The prepare guard therefore has its OWN rules:

- **Re-dispatch gate (the union, restated).** Skip spawning a prepare for `num` when EITHER a live prepare-guard
  entry exists for it OR `state.prs` has an OPEN PR for that `num` (which, while the item is still unscoped, can
  only be its prepare — it has no build PR). The open-PR clause is the backstop if the guard is ever lost.
- **Retire a prepare-guard entry ONLY on one of these — NEVER on mere Agent-return:**
  1. **Scope committed** — the item has left `state.unshaped` (the dispatch plan no longer holds it
     `unshaped-no-scope`, i.e. it now carries committed `scope:`). This is the success path; the item will build.
  2. **Prepare PR terminal** — the prepare PR for that `num` reached a terminal state (merged / closed / failed),
     surfaced by its watcher exit or by leaving the OPEN set in `state.prs`.
- **TTL is spawn-to-FIRST-PR only, not spawn-to-merge.** Do NOT inherit the build guard's 3-tick TTL — a healthy
  prepare's spawn→merge span is longer than that, and re-dispatching a slow-but-live prepare is the very bug this
  fixes. The prepare TTL fires for ONE purpose: to catch a prepare Agent that **died before opening its PR**. So:
  if NO open PR for `num` has appeared in `state.prs` within **N ticks (default 5)** of the spawn, assume the
  agent died pre-PR → drop the guard and allow re-dispatch (surface a one-line note). **Once an open prepare PR
  exists for the `num`, the TTL is void** — retirement is PR-terminal (rule 2) and a second prepare is already
  blocked by the open-PR clause, so a slow-landing but healthy prepare is never re-dispatched.

**Retire a BUILD/delivery guard entry three ways** (these are the delivery-guard's rules — a prepare guard uses
its own, above, and in particular does NOT retire on Agent-return):

1. **Claimed → the agent got going.** When the item shows as claimed in `conveyor-state` — its lane appears in
   `state.lanes` (leased) or it has left `state.queue` — drop the entry. This is the normal path, and in the
   headless-runner model (#2703) it is the LOAD-BEARING one: the runner reads it off each tick's fresh state.
2. **Agent completed / errored** — when the delivery `Agent` returns (any result, including an escalation),
   drop its entry. **Note (#2703):** this return-fold requires observing an agent's completion. The headless
   runner spawns no LLM agents (it surfaces them; the bridge spawns), so it observes no return and folds no such
   signal today — build guards retire via the CLAIMED path (1) and the TTL backstop (3). When the headless
   agent-runner backend lands and the runner spawns agents itself, its observed returns feed this path.
3. **TTL EXPIRY (the required backstop).** If an entry is still pending after **N ticks (default 3, ≈ 6 min)**
   without ever showing as claimed, **DROP it and let it re-dispatch**, and surface a one-line note the first
   time (`⚠ #<num> never claimed after <N> ticks — re-dispatching`). This covers an agent that **died after
   spawn but before claiming** (a crash during `acquire`/`npm`, a lost background task, a lost lane race): path
   (1) never fires, and the health/stall scan (now live — below) still can't see this window either, because a
   lane isn't leased or lane→num-mapped until the agent *acquires*, so a die-before-acquire lane never reaches
   `state.lanes` for the scan to flag. Without the TTL the `num` would sit guarded **forever** and that one item
   would silently stop delivering for the whole session. (Once the agent *does* acquire, this guard retires
   `claimed`; a stall AFTER that point is the reaper's + the operator's to reclaim, not this guard's — see below.)

> **`state.health` is LIVE now — it is a real backstop, no longer inert (#2616/#2700).** `lane-pool acquire
> --item=<num>` populates the lane→num map (`.claude/lane-ports.json`) that `conveyor-state`'s stall scan keys on,
> so the scan flags a genuinely stalled lane (a leased lane whose delivery-agent transcript has gone silent past
> the threshold) and `state.health.verdict` reads `warn`. `tick-core` CONSUMES that verdict: the status line shows
> the `⚠ lane-N` warn and each stalled lane becomes a `lane-stalled` note, and the **per-tick lease-reaper (§4c)**
> reclaims the stalled lane's lease on its TTL-stale axis. So health SURFACES the stall and the reaper RECLAIMS it
> — that is the backstop. **What it does NOT do is auto-re-dispatch a guard on a stall:** the stall threshold
> (≈3 min) is far shorter than a guard's spawn-to-death TTL, so treating a stall as a re-dispatch trigger would
> false-positive on a legitimately-quiet but live agent. The guard **TTLs (build rule 3, prepare TTL-to-first-PR,
> fix TTL) stay the re-dispatch backstop** — health informs the reclaim + the operator, it never overrides them.

This is process bookkeeping — which agents the runner surfaced — not a state store: the board stays the single
truth (see *State*).

## 3. How PR outcomes are handled — the runner surfaces, judgment stays main-session

The runner is self-clocked (§2), so it does NOT wait on a `pr-watch` exit to advance — it re-reads fresh
`state.prs` every tick and classifies each conveyor-launched PR's outcome itself, surfacing the ones that need
action. (An optional `pr-watch` fast-path, §4, still gives a snappier merge-time lease release, and `pr-watch`
exit codes carry the SAME contract — `0` merged · `2` parked · `4` closed · `3` timeout · `1` error.) Branch on
the outcome — do not re-derive the verdict; the runner/watcher already classified the PR:

- **merged (watcher `0`)** — the resident drain landed it; the lane is now free (auto-release / the reaper freed
  the lease). It drops from the watched set; the next tick's `dispatch-plan` fills the freed lane. Nothing else.
- **parked (watcher `2`)** — the PR carries a review label. **Which label decides the branch** (`pr-watch` exits
  `2` for all three; the runner reads the label off the fresh `state.prs` row — or `gh pr view <N> --json
  labels` — to tell them apart, #2630):
  - **`review:changes`** — a human bounced this diff and asked for a fix. The runner surfaces `spawnFixes` and
    the bridge **re-dispatches a fix agent into the PR's lane** (§3c below) — this is NOT just surfaced to the
    operator. The repair is script-shaped (reuse the ref, apply the finding, re-push, re-arm review); the fix
    agent does it and hands the PR back `review:pending`. The runner **never** self-clears the review label.
  - **`review:human` / `review:pending`** — an independent human verdict is owed. The runner surfaces it as a
    note; the judgment layer surfaces in chat: **"PR #N
    (#`<num>`) needs review — run `/review N`."** Do **NOT** auto-land it and do **NOT** auto-fix it: a human
    review park is a hard human-only gate. The lane stays held until the review resolves.

  Either way the PR stays OPEN, so the runner keeps surfacing it each tick — a re-armed `review:pending` (after a
  fix) or a fresh human bounce is re-classified on the next tick's state read.
- **closed (watcher `4`)** — the PR was closed without merging (a human abandoned it). The runner surfaces it as
  an **anomaly to investigate** — do NOT run `/review` (a label swap can't land a closed PR). Note the stranded
  lane (the reaper reclaims its lease off the terminal-state axis).
- **timeout (watcher `3`)** — the fast-path watcher's wall-clock budget elapsed with the PR still pending; the
  runner keeps re-reading it each tick regardless. Flag a possibly-stuck lane for the operator if it persists.
- **error (watcher `1`)** — bad arguments / the watcher couldn't run. Report it; a correct fast-path watcher can
  be re-spawned, but the runner's per-tick state read still covers the PR.

### 3c. Auto-re-dispatch a `review:changes` bounce — spawn ONE fix agent into the PR's lane (#2630)

When exit `2` resolves to **`review:changes`** on a PR **this conveyor launched**, a human bounced the diff and
asked for a change. Before #2630 that only parked and a human had to `/finish` it; now the conveyor re-dispatches
a **fix agent** to repair it in the same lane — **UNLESS** the *fix in-flight test* or the *retry cap* suppresses
it (both below). When neither suppresses:

- **Resolve the PR's lane ref and item.** From `state.prs` you have `{ num, prNumber }`; read the head ref with
  `gh pr view <prNumber> --json headRefName` → `lane/<num>-<slug>`. Glob `backlog/<num>-*.md` for the spec path
  and read its `scope:`.
- **Pick a free lane** the same way step 3 does (a `freeSlots` lane minus this tick's builds/prepares/guards) —
  the fix runs in a FRESH clone reset to the pushed lane ref (`acquire --base=<headRef>`), not the original
  lease, so it needs its own free lane.
- **Instantiate [`fix-agent-brief.md`](fix-agent-brief.md)** by substituting its placeholders: `{{ITEM_NUM}}`=`num`,
  `{{PR_NUM}}`=`prNumber`, `{{LANE_REF}}`=the head ref, `{{LANE}}`=the picked lane, `{{SESSION_SLUG}}`=`fix-<num>`,
  `{{SCOPE}}`=the item's `scope:` entries repo-qualified and comma-joined. Those six `{{DOUBLE_BRACE}}` tokens are
  the whole fill — do not rewrite the brief's prose.
- **Spawn it as ONE background `Agent`.** It acquires a lane on the pushed ref, reads the reviewer's finding off
  the PR, applies ONLY that fix, gets the gate green, re-pushes HEAD to the same `lane/*` ref, then **re-arms the
  review** (`review:changes → review:pending` via `scripts/conveyor/rearm-review.mjs`) and exits. It **NEVER**
  self-clears the human review label — the human (or the drain's AI-review convergence pass) re-verdicts the
  re-armed PR.
- **Record a fix-guard entry** `{ pr: prNumber, num, spawnedTick }` AND **bump the per-PR attempt counter**
  (the within-session overlay — see the fix guard below; the entry and the counter are DISTINCT state, and the
  counter's durable source of truth is the PR's re-arm comments, not this overlay). The spawned fix agent posts
  the durable re-arm comment when it re-arms, which is what the count reads back after a restart. The PR stays
  OPEN, so step 4 keeps a watcher on it — when the fix re-arms it to `review:pending`, that exit `2` routes to
  the `review:human`/`review:pending` branch (surface for `/review`), not back into auto-fix.

**The fix guard — its own bookkeeping, and TWO separate pieces of state (do NOT copy the build/prepare guard's
retirement, and do NOT conflate the two).** A fix dispatch tracks:

1. **An in-flight guard entry** `{ pr, num, spawnedTick }` keyed by the **PR number** — "a fix agent for this PR
   is live right now." It is retired (see below) the moment the PR is no longer awaiting an in-flight repair.
2. **A per-PR attempt counter** — "how many auto-fixes this PR has cost in total." It is a SEPARATE longer-lived
   tally that **survives the guard-entry retirement**. Keeping it off the guard entry is the whole point: a human
   bounce → fix → re-arm → human bounces AGAIN is a NEW `review:changes` with NO live guard entry, so if the count
   lived on the entry it would reset to 1 each cycle and the cap below would never bind. The counter must persist
   across fix↔bounce cycles or the loop is unbounded.
   **The DURABLE count derives from the PR itself, not from in-session memory (#2643).** Each completed auto-fix
   posts exactly one re-arm comment (`rearm-review.mjs`, marker `🔧 conveyor fix — re-armed for re-review`), so
   the count is **`countRearmComments(pr.comments)`** — read back off the PR's own comment thread. This is the
   restart-surviving source of truth: a session-side `fixAttempts[pr]` map would start EMPTY on a fresh / restarted
   conveyor, and the next bounce would auto-fix from zero — the cap would never bind (the exact unbounded fix↔bounce
   loop it exists to prevent, and a parallel state store §5 forbids). The mechanized guard binds the cap on
   **`max(in-session tally, durable re-arm count)`**: the durable count is authoritative and restart-surviving; the
   in-session tally is a within-session overlay that ALSO catches a fix agent that **died before re-arming** (it
   posts no comment, so the durable floor can't see it — but the TTL-backstop case must still terminate at the
   human). The tally clears on PR-terminal, and the durable comments become moot once the PR leaves the open set.

Its rules — two suppressions and one cap:

- **Fix in-flight test (skip re-dispatch).** Skip spawning a fix for a PR when a live guard ENTRY (piece 1)
  already exists for it. This is essential: right after you spawn the fix agent, step 4 re-arms a watcher on the
  still-`review:changes` PR (the agent hasn't re-armed yet), so the watcher exits `2` again almost immediately —
  the entry is what stops that second exit-2 from spawning a duplicate fix on a second burned lane.
- **Retry cap (default 3 auto-fix attempts per PR).** BEFORE spawning, check the attempt count (piece 2) —
  `max(in-session tally, countRearmComments(pr.comments))`. Once it has reached **3**, **stop auto-fixing** this PR
  and surface it for `/review` instead (`⚠ PR #N (#<num>) bounced <k>× — auto-fix exhausted, run /review N`).
  Because the count persists across cycles AND survives a restart (it derives from the PR's durable re-arm
  comments), this binds even when each cycle is a fresh human bounce with no live entry, and even when a restart
  wiped the in-session tally — a finding the auto-fixer can't satisfy in a few passes needs a human; never loop a
  fix↔bounce cycle unboundedly.
- **Retire the in-flight guard ENTRY (piece 1) two ways — NOT the attempt counter:** (1) **Re-armed / resolved**
  — a fresh `state.prs` read shows the PR no longer carries `review:changes` (it re-armed to `review:pending`, or
  merged/closed). Drop the ENTRY; **leave `fixAttempts[pr]` intact** (it only clears on PR-terminal). (2) **TTL
  backstop** — if the PR is STILL `review:changes` after **N ticks (default 5)** of the spawn (the fix agent died
  before re-pushing/re-arming), drop the ENTRY and allow a re-dispatch — still gated by the retry cap (the
  counter did NOT reset), so a repeatedly-dying fix still terminates at the human. Clear `fixAttempts[pr]` only
  when the PR reaches a terminal state (merged / closed).

> **Red gate / red CI is NOT watcher-visible AT OPEN.** `pr-watch` reads only `state,mergedAt,labels`, so a

### 3c-ci. Auto-heal a green-at-open PR gone RED / BEHIND — spawn ONE CI-heal agent into the PR's lane (#2666)

§3c repairs a PR a **human** bounced (`review:changes`). This rule repairs a PR **CI** broke: a conveyor PR that
was **green at pr-land** but has since gone **red on a required check** (`state.prs[].ci === 'fail'`) or **BEHIND +
parked**. The dominant cause is `main` advancing under the branch — a sibling scope PR lands, the branch falls
BEHIND, and its `test` job breaks against the new main (a flake is the other cause). Nothing else heals it: the
**delivery agent has long exited** (one agent = one item = one PR), and the **drain skips a red-CI PR**. #2183
rebuilds a BEHIND but **landable** PR, but a PR **parked** `review:human` / `review:pending` is NOT landable, so
#2183 never fires for it. So the conveyor auto-dispatches a **CI-heal agent** — the CI-axis SIBLING of the §3c fix
agent — **UNLESS** the *in-flight test* or the *retry cap* suppresses it. The mechanized tick decides all of this;
you EXECUTE `decisions.spawnCiHeals`.

- **The trigger — a CI regression, not a label** ({@link tick-core.mjs `isCiHealTarget`}). An OPEN
  conveyor-launched PR (`num` ∈ `launchedNums`) that was **green at open** (carries `ready-to-merge` or a review
  park) and is now either **red-CI** (`ci === 'fail'`) or **BEHIND + review-parked** (the not-landable case #2183
  leaves; a BEHIND-but-landable PR is left to #2183). A **`review:changes`** PR is EXCLUDED — the §3c fix loop owns
  it and already rebases. A PR that was **never green** (no such label — a born-red build the delivery agent
  escalated) is EXCLUDED, so this never double-handles a gate-red escalation.
- **What the CI-heal agent does — repair ONLY CI, never the review label.** Instantiate
  [`fix-agent-ci-brief.md`](fix-agent-ci-brief.md) — substitute `{{ITEM_NUM}}`=`num`, `{{PR_NUM}}`=`prNumber`,
  `{{LANE_REF}}`=the head ref, `{{LANE}}`=the picked lane, `{{SESSION_SLUG}}`=`ci-heal-<num>`, `{{SCOPE}}`=the
  item's `scope:`, `{{REASON}}`=`red-ci`/`behind` — and spawn it as ONE background `Agent`. It acquires a lane on
  the pushed ref, **rebases onto current `main`**, diagnoses + repairs the failing check, re-pushes HEAD to the
  same `lane/*` ref, then posts a **durable CI-heal comment** (`scripts/conveyor/ci-heal-mark.mjs`) and exits. It
  **NEVER** touches `review:human` / `review:pending` / `review:changes` / `ready-to-merge` — **only CI is
  repaired**. After the heal the PR lands exactly as its label already said: `ready-to-merge` lands once re-run CI
  is green (the drain); a parked PR still awaits its human `/review`.
- **The CI-heal guard — its own bookkeeping, the SAME two-piece shape as the §3c fix guard (do NOT conflate the
  two counters).** A `{ pr, num, spawnedTick }` **in-flight ENTRY** keyed by PR number ("a CI-heal agent for this
  PR is live now"), plus a **per-PR attempt counter** `ciHealAttempts[pr]` that SURVIVES entry retirement. The cap
  binds on `max(in-session ciHealAttempts, durable prCiHealCounts)` — the durable floor derived from the PR's own
  **CI-heal comments** (`countCiHealComments`, one per completed heal), so a conveyor restart that wipes the
  in-session tally can never reset a PR that already burned its attempts (the #2643 design applied to the CI axis).
  These are SEPARATE from the fix loop's `fixGuards` / `fixAttempts` — a red PR is not a bounced PR.
- **Two suppressions and one cap** (mirroring §3c): (1) **in-flight test** — skip a PR with a live CI-heal ENTRY
  (a second red read on the same episode must not spawn a duplicate heal on a second burned lane); (2) **retry
  cap** (default 3) — at cap, **stop auto-healing** and surface for `/review` (`⚠ PR #N (#<num>) went red/BEHIND
  <k>× — auto CI-heal exhausted, run /review N`); a genuinely-broken diff needs a human, never an unbounded
  heal↔red flap. **Retire the ENTRY** (not the counter) when CI recovers (`ci` no longer `fail` / no longer
  BEHIND) or the PR goes terminal (`resolved`), or on **TTL** (default 5 ticks — the heal agent died before
  re-pushing; still cap-gated on re-dispatch). Clear `ciHealAttempts[pr]` only on PR-terminal.

### 3d. Surface every cleared epic for `/slice` — a cleared epic is a slice trigger, not a dead end (#2645)

An **epic** is a CONTAINER; its work lives in child stories/tasks, so the dispatcher **never** launches it to
build. A cleared `kind:epic` is held **`needs-slice`** (in `plan.held`) and surfaced in `state.needsSlice` (each
entry `{ num, epicState }`). Before this rule such an epic fell into a silent hole — never built, never sliced,
no signal. Now, each tick, for every item in `state.needsSlice`, **surface it to the operator** so it gets
decomposed into buildable children (which the conveyor then dispatches on later ticks):

- **Route by `epicState`** — the surfaced action depends on the epic's state (the same states the readiness view
  uses), so you never prompt a `/slice` on an already-sliced epic:
  - `unsliced` → **`/slice <num>`** — decompose it into buildable child stories. This is the core case.
  - `done` → **`/resolve <num>`** — every child is resolved; the epic just needs its explicit resolve, not a slice.
  - `tracking` → **no slice** — it already has open child slices; those children ARE the work (clear the children,
    not the container). Note it so the operator can `remove` the epic from the conveyor queue.
  - `program` / `parked` → **no slice** — a perpetual program, or a `childlessReason` gates decomposition; surface
    the state, never prompt a slice.
  - `null` (unknown — a loader-degraded read, or an epic armed while not open/unblocked, so `epicState` was never
    derived) → **surface, no auto-route** — show it as an epic awaiting attention; don't presume `/slice`.
- **Surface, do not auto-slice.** Slicing is human judgment (the `/slice` flow is gated on approval per the
  split-backlog-item skill), so the conveyor **surfaces** the epic rather than spawning an autonomous slice agent
  — the deliberately-chosen branch of the spec's "surface **or** auto-run" (auto-slicing an epic without a human
  in the loop is out of scope here). Add a line to the tick status, e.g.
  `⚠ N epic(s) need slicing: #A (/slice) #B (/resolve)`, so a cleared epic is **always** either
  sliced-and-dispatched (once the operator runs `/slice` and its children land + are cleared) or explicitly
  awaiting slice — never silently stalled.
- **No guard, no spawn.** Unlike §3b/§3c this dispatches **no** agent and consumes **no** lane, so it needs no
  in-flight guard — it is a pure per-tick SURFACE of `state.needsSlice`. The epic stays `needs-slice` every tick
  until the operator slices/resolves/removes it (idempotent — re-surfacing the same epic each tick is correct,
  it is a standing "awaiting slice" signal, not a repeated action).

### 3e. Drive every cleared decision — prepare then present (#2647)

A **decision** is NOT build work; its lifecycle is **prepare** then **present**. A cleared `kind:decision` is
held **`needs-decision`** (in `plan.held`) and surfaced in `state.decisions` (each entry `{ num, prepared,
preparedDate }`). Before this rule a cleared decision fell into the same silent hole an epic did — never built
(a decision isn't buildable), and worse, mislabeled `unshaped-no-scope` and aimed at a scope-prediction agent.
Now, each tick, for every item in `state.decisions`, route by its `prepared` flag:

- **UNPREPARED (`prepared === false`) → auto-prepare it: spawn ONE background prepare-decision agent.** This is
  the autonomous half of a decision (the `/prepare` skill is pure agent work — no human judgment yet). It
  mirrors §3b's auto-prepare-scope exactly, one kind over — **UNLESS a prepare for that `num` is already in
  flight** by the *prepare in-flight test* (the union rule below): **skip** re-dispatch when EITHER a live
  decision-prepare-guard entry exists for `num`, OR `state.prs` already has an **OPEN PR for that `num`** (while
  the decision is still un-prepared it has no build PR, so any open PR for its `num` can only be its in-flight
  prepare). Only when NEITHER holds do you spawn:
  - Resolve the item's spec path by **globbing `backlog/<num>-*.md`**.
  - **Pick a prepare lane that no build/prepare/guard already owns this tick** — the same lane-exclusion §3b
    uses (a `freeSlots` lane MINUS this tick's `plan.launch` builds MINUS every guard-held lane). A
    prepare-decision lane is parallel-safe with builds and other prepares: its scope is the one decision's item
    body plus a new `/research/` topic — disjoint from any builder's code scope.
  - Instantiate [`prepare-decision-agent-brief.md`](prepare-decision-agent-brief.md) by substituting its four
    placeholders: `{{ITEM_NUM}}`=`num`, `{{ITEM_SPEC_PATH}}`=the globbed `backlog/<num>-<slug>.md`,
    `{{LANE}}`=the picked lane, `{{SESSION_SLUG}}`=`prepare-decision-<num>`. Those four `{{DOUBLE_BRACE}}`
    tokens are the whole fill — do not rewrite the brief's prose.
  - Spawn it as **one background `Agent`**. It acquires its lane, prepare-holds the decision, runs the
    `/prepare` passes (prior-art research → per-fork classification → author the prepared-fork shape → skeptic
    pass → two-confusion screen → `prepare-stamp` the `preparedDate`), gets the gate green, **runs an
    adversarial review subagent on its prepared forks and addresses the findings to convergence BEFORE opening
    the PR**, then opens ONE `ready-to-merge` PR and `prepare-release`s the hold — **exits without merging**.
    When that PR lands the decision is prepared, so on a later tick `state.decisions` reads it `prepared:true`
    and this section presents it (below).
  - **Record a decision-prepare-guard entry** `{ num, kind: 'prepare-decision', spawnedTick }` — keyed by `num`
    (the contended resource is the decision's authorship). Its retirement is the SAME as §3b's prepare guard
    (retire only when the item leaves `state.decisions[].prepared === false`, i.e. its `preparedDate` landed, or
    the prepare PR closed) — a returning prepare-decision Agent does NOT retire its guard (it returns at PR-open,
    mid-flight).
- **PREPARED (`prepared === true`) → present its forks for ratification. Surface, do not auto-ratify.** A
  prepared decision is ready to *ratify*, and ratifying is human judgment (MEMORY #39 — *never take an unprepared
  decision*; and `/prepare` explicitly does **not** make the call). So — exactly like §3d surfaces an epic
  rather than auto-slicing — the conveyor **presents** the prepared forks and lets the human ratify:
  - **Publish a forks artefact in the chat conveyor** — the conversational surface. Read the prepared item body,
    and publish a self-contained artefact summarizing each `## Fork N` (its options, the bold default, the
    `Skeptic:`/`Screen:` verdicts) so the operator can see and ratify it inline. This is the main-session
    (chat) present channel.
  - **Feed the #2565 console decision-ratify (ruling) surface** — the product/UI conveyor's present channel. The
    console's ruling read/write ports (#2580 / #2581 / #2582) are already built; the autonomous feed that wires
    a prepared decision into them is a **cross-locus follow-up** (see the blocked follow-up item) — until it
    lands, note the prepared decision is available for the console ruling surface and rely on the chat artefact.
  - **Surface for `/next decision`** — add a line to the tick status, e.g.
    `⚖ N decision(s) ready to ratify: #A #B (/next decision)`, so a prepared cleared decision is **always** either
    ratified (once the operator makes the call) or explicitly awaiting ratification — never silently stalled.
  - **No agent, no guard for the present half** — like §3d it is a pure per-tick SURFACE of the prepared rows
    (idempotent; re-presenting each tick is correct — a standing "ready to ratify" signal). Only the *prepare*
    half (above) spawns an agent and carries a guard.

### 3f. Infra-blocked — a first-class state for a PRE-PR infra failure (#2659)

Between "the agent built + pushed its ref" and "the PR is open" there is a real failure window: `gh pr create`
can fail on an **outside dependency** (a GitHub partial outage — grounded in the 2026-07-24 incident that blocked
#2654's PR-open — or a network fault). That built + pushed work is **not** a review-park, a stall, or gate-red,
and the PR watcher can't see it (no PR exists). Before #2659 it was silently stranded. Now it is a **first-class
state** the conveyor owns end-to-end:

- **Recorded, never lost.** `pr-land` detects a KNOWN-transient PR-open failure (a GitHub 5xx / rate-limit /
  network fault — a genuine error like a bad body or "already exists" is NOT infra and still hard-fails, never a
  doomed retry) and records the **resumable handle** (the pushed `lane/*` ref + its tip + base + body) into the
  conveyor infra-blocked sidecar. It exits `blocked-on-infra` (exit 4), leaving `main` untouched.
- **Auto-retried + resume-opened.** The §4b recovery pass owns an idempotent exponential-backoff retry loop:
  once GitHub recovers it resume-opens the PR **from the recorded ref via `pr-land`** (which never merges — the
  drain lands it). At the attempt cap it stops and surfaces.
- **Reads DISTINCT from a stall or a review-park.** An infra-blocked lane shows the ⊘ marker with its failure
  class + retry attempt + countdown, and a widespread outage collapses into ONE **OUTAGE** banner (not N alarms).
  It is excluded from the stall/health scan, so it never mis-reads as a hung lane. When auto-retry is exhausted
  (the cap), the board reads "auto-retry exhausted — resume by hand" so the operator knows to intervene.
- **Nothing you do by hand.** `pr-land` records it, the §4b pass drives it, the board surfaces it. Surface a
  capped/exhausted item to the operator (like a park), and otherwise let the loop resume it.

## 4. Landing is the drain daemon's job — neither the runner nor this session ever merges

Delivery agents stop at `ready-to-merge` — but only **after** each has reviewed its own diff to convergence
(step above) and `pr-land --label-on-green` confirms the `test` check. The **resident drain daemon**
(`plateau:tools/drain-daemon/`) is the single landing serializer: it auto-lands green couples and parks
escalations `review:human` for review in this main session. **The runner decides dispatch and watch; it never
merges and never self-clears a human review.** This skill (the judgment plane) likewise **never runs `gh pr
merge` and never runs a drain** — the drain daemon is the sole writer to `main` (memory rule 104). `state.daemon`
reports the daemon's residency; if it reads `"unavailable"`, tell the operator the resident drain is absent
(escalations still park, but nothing auto-lands until it — or a manual `/drain` — runs).

**Escalation discipline — `review:human` is a good-reason hold, not a default.** Because every delivery agent
runs the adversarial review before opening its PR, a **clean, reviewed, non-statute PR with a green `test`
auto-lands via the daemon with no human in the loop** — that is the norm. Agents escalate `review:human` ONLY
for good reason — a **statute-touching** change, a **gate-red** PR, a **review finding that turns on a named
taste/product/policy call**, or **genuine uncertainty about one specific taste/product/policy call** (never a
blanket hedge) — and **never blanket-park** a clean PR "so a human can see it" (over-parking makes the human
the bottleneck the conveyor exists to remove and dilutes the label). **Diff size, line count, file count, or
unfamiliarity with the touched area are never grounds on their own** — `CARE_WEIGHTS.size`
(`scripts/lib/review-escalation.mjs`) already makes the committee look harder at a large diff, and the scored
rubric caps size at `review:pending`, never `review:human` (#2563); see the delivery-agent brief's Escalations
section for the full rule. Whether to escalate is **judgment**, kept with the agent rather than a script
([we:docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#deterministic-core-thin-judgment](../../docs/agent/platform-decisions.md#deterministic-core-thin-judgment)).
A parked PR the runner surfaces (§3) is handled by its label: a `review:human` / `review:pending` park is
surfaced for `/review` in this session (never auto-landed — a human-only gate); a `review:changes` bounce is
auto-re-dispatched to a fix agent (§3c) that repairs and re-arms it — but the fix agent still **never
self-clears** the review, so the re-armed PR returns to `review:pending` for a human (or the AI-review pass) to
verdict, never straight to `review:accepted`.

## 5. State is the board's channels only — no parallel store

Everything the conveyor and its agents do flows through the **normal verbs**: `acquire` a lane → claim → build
in the `lane/<num>` branch → `pr-land` → the daemon merges → resolve. Those are **exactly** the channels the
plateau lane board reads (`claimed.session`, `queued.lane`, `pr.state`+`ci`, the scope-lease collect). So the
board reflects conveyor state **for free**, and `conveyor-state.mjs` reads that same truth. **Never keep a
parallel state store of item / claim / PR / resolve state** — the only bookkeeping allowed is ephemeral
*process* tracking, and since #2703 it lives in the **runner's** process (threaded through `nextState`, not this
session's context): which delivery / prepare-scope / prepare-decision / fix / CI-heal `Agent`s and which
`pr-watch` processes were spawned (the in-flight dispatch guard, the prepare-scope guard, the
**decision-prepare guard** (§3e), the in-flight **fix-guard ENTRY** (§3c), the in-flight **CI-heal-guard ENTRY**
(§3c-ci), and the watched-PR set). The two attempt counters (`fixAttempts` / `ciHealAttempts`) are session
overlays whose durable floor is the PR's own re-arm / CI-heal comments — the count IS PR state, not a parallel
store. That
is not item state; it is which background jobs are live — the re-arm swap and every repair still flow through the
board's normal verbs (`git push … lane/*` → `rearm-review.mjs` → the PR's labels → the daemon / `/review`).

The **auto-fix retry count** is the case that proves the rule (#2643): "how many times this PR was auto-fixed" is
**PR state, not process state**, so it must NOT live in a session-side map (a restart would wipe it and the cap
would silently stop binding). It **derives from the PR itself** — `countRearmComments(pr.comments)`, one durable
re-arm comment per completed auto-fix — so it survives a restart with no parallel store. The in-session tally the
mechanized guard also keeps is a within-session *overlay* over that durable count (it only adds coverage for a fix
agent that died before posting its re-arm comment); the durable comment thread is the source of truth.

## 6. Idle-stop (the runner stops itself; a fresh `/conveyor` restarts it)

Idle-stop is the tick core's decision (`decisions.idleStop`) and the **runner** acts on it — the main session
arms no `sleep` to stop. Two signals only: the **queue is empty** (no `buildQueued` items in `state.queue`, no
in-flight lanes/PRs) **AND** there has been **no operator feedback for the configured idle window** (default
15 min — measured from the last chat turn). When both hold, the runner STOPS its loop and releases its singleton
lease (it also stops on a lost lease or a spent `--max-ticks` budget). Announce the stop to the operator. The
conveyor does not outlive its purpose; a fresh `/conveyor` starts a new runner.

> `state.queue`'s `buildQueued` now reflects the SESSION-LOCAL conveyor queue (`.conveyor/queue.json`, #2613),
> so `state.queue.filter(buildQueued)` is exactly what the operator cleared this session — the reliable
> queue-empty half.
>
> **Do NOT gate idle-stop on `state.idle.lastQueueAdd`.** That field is sourced from the **drain's**
> `queued.json` (the ready-to-merge token queue), **not** the conveyor queue the operator feeds with
> `queue.mjs add` — a fresh clear never updates it, so it is the wrong signal for "was work queued recently".
> The queue-empty test above already reads the conveyor queue correctly (via `state.queue`), which is the
> reliable half; rely on queue-empty + operator-feedback and ignore the `lastQueueAdd` grace clause until a
> conveyor-queue clear timestamp is wired into the state read.

## 7. Final ledger (on stop)

When the runner stops — idle-stop, lease-loss, or the operator ends it — post one final ledger from the last
state read:

> **delivered** (merged this session) · **parked** (PRs awaiting `/review`, with numbers) · **stranded** (lanes
> whose PR closed/timed-out and need a look).

Release nothing yourself — delivery agents and the drain own their lanes; a stranded lane is surfaced, not
force-released, so the operator decides.

## 8. Interim status surface — the periodic artifact refresh (no product UI yet)

**WHILE the product console UI does not exist** (the Plateau-Loop console board — #2527 *autonomous AI build
queue*, #2505 *operable backlog console*, #2555 *launch review console board* — none of which is built yet), the
conveyor keeps a **live status board** the operator can watch. It is generated by a committed, dependency-free
script and republished as an **Artifact** on the same ~5-min heartbeat the runner ticks on:

```bash
node scripts/conveyor/status-artifact.mjs > /tmp/conveyor-status.html   # from the WE repo root
```

- **What it renders.** One self-contained HTML page (CSS inlined) — a KPI row (merged-today / building /
  in-review / landing), the four-stage flow (ready · in-review · landing · needs-you), the **lane pool** with
  ghost-lease flagging, an **"Epics — progress"** section with a per-epic child-state rollup, the buildable
  **remaining-backlog** table (epic rows excluded — they live in the Epics section), and **merged-today**. It
  reads the SAME live truth everything else does — `conveyor-state.mjs` + `dispatch-plan.mjs` +
  `lane-pool.mjs status` + `gh pr list` + a backlog scan — and invents no state (the *State* rule §5: no parallel
  store).
- **The generator is deterministic + READ-ONLY; the PUBLISH step is the SESSION's — name the seam honestly.** The
  script only shells reads and prints HTML to stdout — it mutates nothing (no repo write, no PR, no merge), so it
  is safe to run every heartbeat. What it does **not** do is publish: turning that HTML into a shareable Artifact
  uses the **Artifact tool, which is a session capability**, not something a headless script or the runner can
  call. So today the refresh is a two-step interim seam — *script generates (mechanical, reproducible) → this
  session publishes (a session-only capability)* — and that publish half is exactly what does not yet exist
  session-free. State it plainly rather than pretending the board hosts itself: it is a stopgap until the app
  hosts the board (below).
- **The heartbeat DOUBLES as the pipeline-drop check — refill prep proactively on every refresh.** Each ~5-min
  regeneration is also the cue to read the board for a **prep-pipeline drop** — idle lanes, or a thin `ready`
  queue (few scoped-and-dispatchable items) — and, when you see one, **refill the prep pipeline** so the
  conveyor never runs dry. The board surfaces exactly what to refill, and each maps to a mechanism this skill
  already owns: **needs-scope items → dispatch a prepare-scope agent** (§3b); **a cleanly-sliceable epic →
  `/slice` it into buildable stories** (§3d); **an unprepared decision → prepare it, and preview a prepared one
  for ratify** (§3e). This is the standing *keep the prep pipeline full proactively* discipline — don't wait for
  the `ready` queue to hit zero; top it up every heartbeat so scoped work is always waiting when a lane frees.
  (The runner's per-tick auto-prepare already does most of this mechanically; the heartbeat read is the judgment
  backstop that catches what needs an operator nudge — an epic to slice, a decision to prepare.)
- **This whole interim surface is RETIRED when the session-free product board lands.** The end state is the
  **Session-free conveyor** roadmap epic **#2753** (*reduce the operator session to queue + expose-state*), whose
  "residue" list names **board generation** as one of the things that moves into the session-free runner/app —
  i.e. the product console (#2527) hosts the live board and no session publishes an Artifact by hand. Until
  #2753's board-generation residue lands, this script + heartbeat-publish is the honest stopgap; when it does,
  delete this section and the periodic-publish habit with it.

---

## The split, restated (why this skill is safe to keep thin)

Per #deterministic-core-thin-judgment (#2607) and its child #conveyor-orchestration-mechanics-not-per-lane-agent
(#2701), the line runs between **two planes**:

- **The mechanical plane — the HEADLESS RUNNER + the scripts it shells (deterministic, tested; no model context
  per tick):** the runner (`skills-src/conveyor/runner.mjs`, #2702) stepping the **mechanized tick core** (#2699
  — `scripts/conveyor/tick-core.mjs`: the guards + their retirement, the union re-dispatch gate, watcher arming,
  and idle-stop, all decided in one pure call the runner threads forward, never re-derives), over the tick state
  read, the dispatch plan, the merge-watcher verdict, the idle-clock inputs, the health/stall scan, and the
  **infra-blocked classify + backoff + resume decision** (#2659 — what counts as a retryable outage, the retry
  schedule, and when to resume vs surface are all in `scripts/conveyor/infra-blocked.mjs`, never re-derived in
  prose). Same inputs → same output. Since #2703 this whole plane is the runner's, not the main session's — the
  serial main-session tick loop is retired.
- **The judgment plane (stays with the operator + this main session + the agents — this skill's real content):**
  the readiness discussion,
  clearing items for build, supervising a build, **each prepare-scope agent's touch-set prediction**, **each
  delivery agent's adversarial review of its own diff**, **each fix agent's application of the reviewer's
  finding** (the repair itself — routed by the deterministic exit-2 label, but the fix is judgment), the
  **escalate-or-auto-land call**, reviewing an escalation (`/review`), and investigating an anomaly. The
  `review:changes → review:pending` re-arm, by contrast, is a script-decidable swap (`rearm-review.mjs`) — the
  fix agent shells it, never re-deriving the "never clear the human gate" rule in prose. Never spend model context re-deriving a computable plan —
  read the script's answer and act on it. **Build-vs-prepare-vs-slice-vs-decide is NOT a judgment call here — it
  is the dispatch plan's classification:** `plan.launch` → build (scoped, §3); `held: unshaped-no-scope` /
  `state.unshaped` → prepare scope (unscoped, §3b); `held: needs-slice` / `state.needsSlice` → surface for
  `/slice` (an epic container, §3d); `held: needs-decision` / `state.decisions` → prepare-or-present a decision
  (§3e — an UNPREPARED one spawns a prepare-decision agent; a PREPARED one is surfaced/presented for ratify, no
  agent). The runner surfaces the matching decision and — until the headless agent-runner backend lands — the
  judgment-layer bridge spawns the matching agent (or, for an epic or a prepared decision, surfaces it — no
  agent). Starting/supervising the runner is itself part of this plane. The one judgment that stays human
  throughout: **ratifying** a presented decision (never autonomous).
