/**
 * @file skills-src/conveyor/supervisor-launcher.mjs
 * @description #3874 (epic #3383) — the thin top-level launcher that gives EVERY resident conveyor daemon
 *   named in {@link ./daemon-manifest.mjs}'s closed allowlist the same restart-on-crash / back-off-on-a-
 *   crash-loop protection we:skills-src/conveyor/supervisor.mjs already built for the Dispatcher
 *   (we:skills-src/conveyor/runner.mjs) alone — without a single line of supervisor.mjs changing.
 *
 * CORRECTED PREMISE #1 (documented in full in this item's own backlog card, backlog/3874-…md's `## Progress`
 * section). The card that opened this item asks whether we:skills-src/conveyor/supervisor.mjs's CLI "takes a
 * `--pass=` style flag itself" to pick which script it supervises. Read directly (its own `main()`): it does
 * not. `main()` hardcodes `RUNNER_PATH = join(HERE, 'runner.mjs')` and forwards every OTHER flag straight to
 * that fixed target — there is no flag, env var, or other lever to redirect it. Spawning N copies of
 * `node supervisor.mjs` would therefore spawn N supervisors of the SAME runner.mjs, never one per manifest
 * entry. What supervisor.mjs's own file DOES already offer, proven generic by its OWN test suite (see
 * `makeRealSpawnChild — real node child processes, never runner.mjs itself` in
 * we:skills-src/conveyor/__tests__/supervisor.test.mjs, which spawns arbitrary `-e` scripts, never
 * runner.mjs), is its EXPORTED pure core: {@link runSupervisorLoop} (the whole restart/backoff control flow,
 * every effect injected) and `makeRealSpawnChild` (the real `child_process` wiring, parameterized by
 * `runnerPath`/`extraArgs`). This launcher imports both UNMODIFIED and drives one restart/backoff loop per
 * manifest entry — each of which spawns a REAL, independent child OS process running that entry's own
 * script — inside this one launcher process. Zero edits to supervisor.mjs.
 *
 * CORRECTED PREMISE #2. {@link DAEMON_MANIFEST} does NOT already carry 15 real entries. Read directly (its
 * own file header, and we:skills-src/conveyor/__tests__/daemon-manifest.test.mjs's own first assertion): it
 * starts EMPTY, by design — #3871 built the mechanism only. #3873 (wiring the 8 watcher passes onto
 * we:skills-src/conveyor/pass-daemon.mjs) is still `status: open`, unbuilt, at the time this launcher was
 * written. This launcher is built to be correct against that reality: it takes whatever names are CURRENTLY
 * registered (or an explicit `--only=` subset) with zero hardcoded entry names of its own, so the exact same,
 * unchanged file picks up #3873's watchers — and any later Dispatcher/Fix-dispatch/Review/Verify entries —
 * the moment a sibling slice registers them, with no code change here. It deliberately does NOT itself
 * register any new entries into the shared allowlist: {@link resolveManifestEntry} is also what
 * we:skills-src/conveyor/pass-daemon.mjs resolves `--pass=<name>` through, so adding an entry here would
 * silently change what THAT daemon can also be pointed at — a real product decision belonging to whichever
 * slice actually wires each script, not a side effect of building this launcher (this item's own `scope`
 * only ever named we:skills-src/conveyor/supervisor.mjs).
 *
 * CORRECTED PREMISE #3 (round 2 of PR #2472's review; documented in full in backlog/3874-…md's `## Progress`
 * section, fourth correction). The paragraph immediately below this one, as originally written, claimed "no
 * new locking primitive is needed at this layer" and that EVERY resident script this launcher targets
 * "already protects itself against a duplicate live instance with its OWN lease." Read directly against what
 * this file's OWN manifest entries actually are TODAY (every one of the 15 real {@link DAEMON_MANIFEST}
 * entries, #3873): none of `branch-drift.mjs`/`ci-queue-watch.mjs`/etc. take their own lease directly — that
 * lease (we:skills-src/conveyor/pass-daemon.mjs's `passDaemonLeaseKey(name)`) is acquired ONLY by
 * we:skills-src/conveyor/pass-daemon.mjs's OWN IO shell, which THIS launcher bypassed entirely by spawning
 * each entry's script directly. Worse, {@link planLaunchTargets} silently dropped every entry's own
 * `intervalMs` (documented on {@link ../daemon-manifest.mjs}'s own `DaemonManifestEntry` typedef as "how often
 * pass-daemon.mjs re-runs this pass"), so a launched entry's clean, expected exit (`code:0`) fell straight
 * into supervisor.mjs's `decideRestart`, which gives an ordinary clean exit `delayMs: 0` — an IMMEDIATE
 * respawn, forever, completely ignoring the entry's own pacing. That is worse than the race this section
 * used to describe as the worst case: not an occasional overlap with a concurrently-running
 * `pass-daemon.mjs --pass=<name>`, but a permanent zero-delay busy-loop re-running every currently-registered
 * entry nonstop the instant this launcher's `main()` is ever actually invoked against real manifest entries.
 *
 * FIXED by making {@link launchEntry} do two things supervisor.mjs's own reused-unmodified core cannot do on
 * its own, since every current manifest entry is a PERIODIC ONE-SHOT pass (runs to completion, then waits
 * `intervalMs`, then runs again) — a fundamentally different shape than supervisor.mjs's own target
 * (we:skills-src/conveyor/runner.mjs, a process that should basically never exit, where any exit is a crash to
 * restart-with-backoff):
 *   1. Take the SAME `passDaemonLeaseKey(name)` lease we:skills-src/conveyor/pass-daemon.mjs would take for
 *      `--pass=<name>` — imported and reused UNMODIFIED, never re-derived — before spawning anything, so a
 *      real concurrent `pass-daemon.mjs --pass=<name>` instance and this launcher's own copy of the same
 *      entry genuinely contend for one lease rather than both running. One held for this entry's WHOLE
 *      lifetime (acquired once, heartbeat throughout, released on stop) — mirrors
 *      we:skills-src/conveyor/pass-daemon.mjs's own `main()` shape exactly, not a per-run acquire/release.
 *   2. Drive each entry through {@link runPeriodicSupervisorLoop} (this file's own new pure-core function,
 *      NOT supervisor.mjs's `runSupervisorLoop`) instead: reuses supervisor.mjs's `classifyExit`/`decideRestart`
 *      UNMODIFIED for the "was this actually a crash" question (a non-zero exit or death-by-signal is still
 *      classified and backed off exactly as supervisor.mjs already does), but a CLEAN exit paces the next run
 *      by the entry's own `intervalMs` (now threaded through by {@link planLaunchTargets}) — mirroring
 *      we:skills-src/conveyor/pass-daemon.mjs's own `runPassDaemonLoop` pacing — rather than supervisor.mjs's
 *      `delayMs: 0` assumption, which is only correct for a long-running resident whose exit is a polite
 *      stand-down, never for a periodic pass whose clean exit is the NORMAL, expected outcome of every run.
 *
 * `classifyExit`'s own `too-short` heuristic (anything under `crashThresholdMs`, default 3s) is tuned for
 * we:skills-src/conveyor/runner.mjs's own tick shape — "a real tick reliably costs low-hundreds of ms," per
 * that file's own doc comment — which does NOT hold for an arbitrary one-shot watcher pass that may
 * legitimately finish in well under 3s (e.g. a quick "nothing to do" check). Reusing the 3s default here would
 * misclassify a fast, successful, expected run as a crash. {@link runPeriodicSupervisorLoop} therefore calls
 * `classifyExit` with `crashThresholdMs: 0` by default (still overridable) — signal-death and a non-zero exit
 * code are UNAMBIGUOUS crash signals regardless of runtime and are still always classified `'crash'`; only the
 * runtime-based `'too-short'` heuristic (inapplicable to this class of script) is disabled.
 *
 * WHAT THIS DOES NOT SOLVE (open question, not this fix's scope — see backlog/3874-…md's own THIRD
 * correction). {@link DAEMON_MANIFEST}'s schema (#3871) requires `intervalMs` on EVERY entry; there is today no
 * discriminator marking an entry as a genuinely long-running RESIDENT (Dispatcher, Fix-dispatch, Review,
 * Verify — this card's own stated eventual targets) rather than a periodic one-shot pass. A resident entry
 * has no periodic-pacing concept and should still go through supervisor.mjs's own `runSupervisorLoop`
 * unchanged; that split needs a manifest-schema addition (e.g. an explicit `kind` field) belonging to whichever
 * slice actually registers the first resident entry — this fix only corrects what is real today, where every
 * entry is a periodic one-shot pass.
 *
 * PURE-CORE / IO-SHELL SPLIT (mirrors this epic's established shape — see we:skills-src/conveyor/pass-daemon.mjs
 * and we:skills-src/conveyor/review-daemon.mjs headers):
 *   • {@link planLaunchTargets}, {@link defaultLaunchNames}, and {@link runPeriodicSupervisorLoop} are the pure
 *     core — no IO of their own, `resolveEntry`/`manifest`/every effect injected, unit-tested against fixture
 *     manifests and fake effects (skills-src/conveyor/__tests__/supervisor-launcher.test.mjs) — never the real
 *     `DAEMON_MANIFEST` for the fixture-driven cases. One bad name never aborts the rest (mirrors this epic's
 *     own "one bad entry never aborts the rest" discipline: reconcile-pass.mjs's per-PR isolation,
 *     review-daemon.mjs's per-repo isolation).
 *   • {@link launchEntry} and {@link launchAll} are IO-shell GLUE that itself takes injectable
 *     `runLoop`/`makeSpawnChild`/`makeLog`/`acquireLease`/`heartbeatLease`/`releaseLease` (defaulting to the
 *     real, unmodified exports this header describes above) — unit-tested with fakes for all of those, so no
 *     real subprocess and no real lease file is ever touched by the unit suite. A SEPARATE integration suite
 *     (skills-src/conveyor/__tests__/supervisor-launcher.integration.test.mjs) drives `launchEntry` with NO
 *     injected `spawnChild`/`runLoop` against a realistic one-shot fixture script, proving the real
 *     `classifyExit`/`runPeriodicSupervisorLoop`/lease path — the exact gap the review named (every prior test
 *     here only ever exercised injected fakes).
 *   • `main()` (gated on direct invocation, exactly like supervisor.mjs's own) is the ONLY code path that
 *     actually spawns real children — it resolves the CLI's requested names, launches one supervised loop
 *     per entry, and forwards SIGINT/SIGTERM to every live child so a stopped launcher never leaves one
 *     orphaned.
