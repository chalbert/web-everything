# Finish stuck lanes — take over the producer's half-done work, then land (#2200)

> **Invoked as `/finish`.** (Was `/resume`, renamed 2026-07-03 — `/resume` is a Claude Code built-in that
> shadowed the skill so it never dispatched. The mechanism + `lane-resume.mjs` keep the "resume" mnemonic.)

`/drain` lands couples that are **already ready**. But a producer (`/workflow`, `/batch`) routinely leaves
lanes that *aren't* ready — a **conflict** with a peer that landed first, a red required **`test`** (the lane
shipped a real bug), or (rarely) a **`blockedBy`** item that isn't landed yet. `/drain` skips those forever.
`/finish` is the consumer that **takes them over**: it seeds a finisher subagent with the **existing lane ref**
(reuse the ~done work — never rebuild from scratch), repairs only the broken part, and hands the now-ready
couple to the normal drain transport.

> **Reuse, not rebuild.** The work sits intact on the `lane/*` refs (WE + any coupled `frontierui` ref). Only
> the *landing* broke. A finisher clones the existing ref, rebases onto `main`, and fixes what's red — it does
> NOT re-provision a fresh lane or redo the item.

## Preconditions

- Run the mechanical parts from an **isolated clean clone on `main`** — never the shared primary checkout
  (#2197: a dirty primary makes the housekeeping `git pull` conflict and strands the tree mid-merge).
  Provision one outside `.lanes/` and **never `git pull` in the primary** — all fetch/rebase/sync happens in
  the clone. (Env setup for the finisher — symlink `node_modules` + a sibling `../frontierui` — is in the
  finisher playbook below.)
- `gh` authenticated (`gh auth status`). Landing goes through the same self-approved transport as `/drain`
  (`scripts/merge-ai-prs.mjs` / `scripts/pr-land.mjs`).
- The single-branch guard forbids `git checkout <branch>` / `git switch` / worktrees in shared checkouts. A
  finisher gets a real working tree by **`git clone --branch <laneRef> --single-branch`** (clone is not
  guarded) and pushes only to `lane/*` (allowed) — no branch switch anywhere.

## Run it

```
node scripts/lane-resume.mjs discover            # classify every stuck ready-to-merge lane + why, blockedBy-ordered
node scripts/lane-resume.mjs discover --json     # same, machine-readable (the plan the skill iterates)
node scripts/lane-resume.mjs land <pr> --dry-run # plan the land of ONE repaired lane PR (merge vs rebase-drop vs skip)
node scripts/lane-resume.mjs land <pr>           # land it: rebase-drop the manifest if only it conflicts, then gh pr merge
```

**Always `discover` first.** It buckets the labelled PRs into `ready` (not stuck — `/drain` takes them),
`conflict` (rebase + resolve), `test-red` (a real bug to fix), `blocked` (blocker not landed — defer), and
`unknown` (recompute mergeability and re-run). It reads each lane's `.lane-manifest.json` for `item` / `repos`
/ `blockedBy`, treats a blocker as landed when its backlog file is `status: resolved` on `main`, and orders
lanes so none precedes one it is `blockedBy`.

## How the skill drives it (per pass)

1. **`discover --json`** → the ordered plan. Drop `ready` (hand to `/drain`) and `blocked` (report, defer).
2. **For each remaining lane, in order**, spawn ONE finisher subagent (Agent tool) seeded with the lane. Run
   **independent lanes in parallel**; keep a `blockedBy` chain **serial**. For a **cross-repo** couple, the
   finisher lands the impl (`frontierui`) ref **before** the WE ref (impl-first / WE-last).
3. The finisher's contract (seed = the existing ref, NOT fresh `main`):
   - `git clone --branch <laneRef> --single-branch … && cd …`; symlink `node_modules` + a sibling
     `../frontierui` if the gate/generators need them.
   - `git fetch origin main && git merge FETCH_HEAD` → **resolve conflicts**; **regenerate derived artifacts**
     rather than hand-merging them (e.g. `node scripts/grammar-scorecard.mjs` re-emits the fidelity report).
   - Run the **full** scoped gate/tests (not the file-scoped fast-fail) — the lane owns a CI-green PR (#2199).
   - **drop the transient `.lane-manifest.json`**, commit, `git push origin HEAD:refs/heads/<laneRef>`, and
     confirm the required `test` check goes green.
4. **Land** the repaired couple. Either hand the now-clean PR to `/drain` (`node scripts/merge-ai-prs.mjs
   --label=ready-to-merge`), or land ONE PR directly with `node scripts/lane-resume.mjs land <pr>` (#2202) —
   both share the ONE #2198 rebase-drop-manifest helper, so a lane that only conflicts on the manifest lands
   without a human. Impl-first/WE-last, `blockedBy` order.

### The one knob — how autonomous on a red test

- **resolve-only (default):** finishers fix *conflicts + regenerated artifacts* (mechanical, safe) and land
  those. A genuinely-red `test` is reported back, not code-patched.
- **`--fix` (opt-in):** the finisher also debugs and fixes the failing code, then lands. Powerful, but an agent
  "making tests pass" can paper over a real bug — only with explicit go.

## Finisher playbook (#2202 — learned on the 2026-07-03 run)

**Env setup (do this first in every finisher clone).** Generators and gates need real deps and the sibling
impl repo: **symlink `node_modules` from the primary** (`ln -s <primary>/node_modules node_modules`) and make
the clone a **sibling of a `../frontierui`** checkout (cross-repo artifact builds resolve `../frontierui`). A
missing either → the gate fails with a spurious "cannot find module" that looks like a code bug but is an env
gap.

**Conflict resolution table — resolve each conflicted path by its CLASS, never a blind hand-merge:**

| Conflicted path | Resolution |
|---|---|
| `.lane-manifest.json` (the transient manifest) | **drop it** — it is per-lane bookkeeping, not content (the `land`/drain helper does this automatically). |
| coordination JSON — `claims`/`reservations`/`capacity`/`queued` — and the `.claude/agent-memory/` tree | **take-main** — a peer session owns the newer state; your lane's copy is stale. |
| generated artifacts — grammar-scorecard report, `we:AGENTS.md`, parity report | **REGENERATE, don't hand-merge** — re-run the generator (`gen:inventory`, `grammar-scorecard.mjs`, the parity report) so the output matches the merged inputs. |
| code | **union additive by intent** (keep both sides' additions when they're independent). A genuine **same-line overlap** → **STOP and report** — never guess which side wins. |

**Recurring test-red root causes (fix MINIMALLY — never weaken or delete a test):**

- **epic-closeout** — resolving the last child of an epic ⇒ the umbrella epic must be resolved too (the
  all-slices-done gate). Resolve the parent.
- **living-catalog count-pins** — a new deliverable moves a `toBe(N)` count assertion. Bump the pinned N to the
  new true count (the test is a catalog census, not a regression).
- **reports-not-hidden** — a new `reports/*.md` the item produced trips the "report not referenced" gate. Add a
  `relatedReport:` field to the backlog item pointing at it.
- **stale generated inventory** — `we:AGENTS.md`'s generated block drifted. Regenerate it (`npm run
  gen:inventory`); never hand-edit the generated region.
- **backlog id-collision** — two files claim one NNN. The **newcomer yields** to the next free NNN
  (`scripts/backlog-renumber-collisions.mjs`, or rename by hand to the next free id).

**Landing nuances:**

- `UNSTABLE` + `test=pass` **IS mergeable** — only the `test` check is required; `cla` / Workers-Builds are
  non-required and their red never blocks a land (`landDecision` encodes this).
- **Land shared-file lanes SERIALLY and re-rebase between them** — two lanes touching one file each need the
  later one rebased onto the just-landed main; don't fan them out concurrently.
- **`discover` should warm-recompute mergeability** (`gh pr view` each) so no lane shows `UNKNOWN` — an
  `unknown` disposition means the recompute hasn't run yet, not that the lane is unlandable.

## Guardrails

- **Reuses transports, never re-implements them** — repair happens in the lane clone; landing is `/drain` +
  `pr-land`. No raw `git merge`/`git push` of `main`.
- **Never rebuilds a lane from scratch** — always seeds the finisher with the existing ref. If a lane is
  truly unrecoverable, report it; don't silently re-do the item.
- **Idempotent** — a re-run's `discover` no longer lists a landed lane; a partially-repaired lane resumes from
  its pushed state.
- **Respects `blockedBy`** — never finishes a lane ahead of an unlanded blocker.
