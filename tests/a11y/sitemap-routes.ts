// Auto-derived route set for the rendered-site a11y gate (#847, per #774 Fork-1=C + Fork-2=A).
//
// Replaces the hand-maintained route-allowlist.ts (#770): instead of a list someone edits when a
// surface ships, the gate reads /sitemap.xml (#846 — 11ty's complete page knowledge over
// collections.all) and filters it to **scope-C** — every index surface + one representative detail
// page per path-prefix group. One template per collection (`*-pages.njk`) means a detail-page
// violation is almost always a shared-template bug, so a single sample per group catches it at ~1%
// of the all-pages cost. Mechanism is pa11y-ci's `--sitemap` posture: consume the published sitemaps.org
// artifact, never reach into build internals or re-derive permalinks (#774 rejected globbing `_site`
// and reconstructing from `_data`).
//
// FORCED INVARIANT (#774, not a fork): the enforce posture #793/#805 earned is preserved by an explicit
// ENFORCED_ROUTES set, decoupled from the derived set. A newly-derived route enters **warn-only**
// (most-permissive default); it is promoted per-route as it goes green. Resetting every route to
// warn-only would silently un-earn the 10 build-blocking routes — the broken alternative.
